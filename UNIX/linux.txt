How to use the Linux binaries for Fly8:

1  To change the initial window size, adjust the fly.ini option:
	mstandard
   to some other mode from grx.vmd, or otherwise adjust the definition
   of 'standard' in grx.vmd.
   You can always resize the window later...

2  To use the joystick select a new pointer device in fly.ini by commenting
   out the current 'dp...' line (which by defaults uses the mouse) to one
   of the joystick lines ('dpAstick').
   Note that if you use the <linux/game.h> type joystick driver then you MUST
   add the ':game' option to the stick definition. The default assumes a
   <linux/joystick.h> style driver.
   You may want then to adjust the other stick parameters for your situation.

3  For multiplayer games you will need to enable some of the lines at the
   bottom of fly.ini; refer to the doc file for networking information.
