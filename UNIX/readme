How to install the sources from a xxxx.zip file:

1) unzip -La xxxx.zip

   On older 'unzip' use:

   unzip -xa xxxx.zip

   Will create a directory 'fly8' with all the stuff underneath. The '-a'
   is needed since it was packed on MSDOS. If you do not have 'unzip'
   then get it, it compiles nicely on most systems.

   I normally install it under games/src.

2) cd fly8

   That's where everything is.

3) sh unix/setfly8

   All platform directories should be uppercase. MSDOS looses the case.

4) UNIX/config lx	(for Linux)
   UNIX/config sp	(for SUN SparcStation)
   UNIX/config ix	(for SGI Irix)

   Will set everything up. For other systems you will need to update all
   the *lx* files into new *zz* files for your platform. However, except
   for the joystick driver there is no Linux specific code, so just
   disabling the stick (in config.h) may get it going on your *unix*.
   Most of the dependencies are in the config.h file. Also, some
   makefiles use 'awk' or 'nawk'.

5) About Linux joysticks.

   If you use the 'joystick.o' driver, you will, in the /js directory:

	cp joystick.h /usr/include/linux

   Kernel 1.2.x and early 1.3.x need kernel_version[] to be defined in each
   loadable module - in which case you need to replace the "#if 0" with
   "#if 1" early in js\joystick.c. To build do:

	make
	make devs

   The last step is required if you do not yet have /dev/js0 and /dev/js1.

   To copy the module to the right place do:

	make install

   Before using the joystick, you will have to load the module:

	insmod joystick.o

   To see if your joystick was recognized, check

	dmesg

   and you may remove the driver with:

	rmmod joystick

   Note that you will want to have "-DUSE_JOY" in the top Makefile to enable
   this joystick support.

   If you are using the game.h based joystick then define "-DUSE_GAME".

   To use the Colorado Workstation GamePort define "-DUSE_GP".

6) make all

   But first check 'Makefile', esp. the INSTALLDIR definition.

7) cd docs
   ./dodoc
   cd ..

   This will create fly8.doc from fly8.mm. Or do 'dodvi' for fly8.dvi. I
   think that these days there may already be a fly8.doc in the package
   though; it sure is in the binary packages.

8) make install

   Will copy stuff to the install directory. Check the makefile first as
   to where it installs it (INSTALLDIR).

9) Now use it. Change to the install directory and run as 'fly8 &'. Or
   try 'fly8 z5 &' for 5 drones and autopilot engaged.

10) There is a script 'fly' which may be placed in your /usr/loacl/bin or
   something which will then run fly8 from any directory directly. Just
   change the install directory there. Note that if you often use common
   options then these can be put into the fly.ini file or left in the
   FLY8 environment variable.


In summary, here is the script that I use to rebuild Fly8 on Linux. I
run it from /usr/local/src.

	#!/bin/sh
	unzip -La fly8???1.zip
	cd fly
	sh unix/setfly8
	sh UNIX/config lx
	(cd UNIX/js; cp joystick.h /usr/include/linux; make devs all)
	make all 1>errs 2>&1
	(cd docs; ./dodoc)
	make install
	cd ..

On SUN you do not need the joystick stuff and the config is for 'sp'.
