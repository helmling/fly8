How to use the Sun SparcStation binaries for Fly8:

1  To change the initial window size, adjust the fly.ini option:
	mstandard
   to some other mode from grx.vmd, or otherwise adjust the definition
   of 'standard' in grx.vmd.
   You can always resize the window later...

2  For multiplayer games you will need to enable some of the lines at the
   bottom of fly.ini; refer to the doc file for networking information.
