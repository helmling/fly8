[ 5 May 1997]

/proc file is now /proc/joystick. Much more information displayed.
Bit longer load message. Button field returns options on ioctl.

[ 3 May 1996]

Added /proc/net/joystick.
Made it build on 1.2.13 again.
Cleaned printk messages.

Do check the makefile for proper options. It is configured for module
versioning. If you compile for 1.2.13 then set JS_V12.

It was tested with kernels 1.2.13 and the latest up to 1.3.98. It may
have problems with earlier 1.3.x - I do not have these around anymore.


[ 2 Dec 1995]

Kernel 1.3 modules already define 'kernel_version'. Remove the '#if 0'
part for earlier kernels.

Hello Everyone,

This is my version of the loadable joystick driver. It is based on
earlier work by other people and myself. It was recently modified
significantly and has probably very little left from the original.

The loadable stuff comes from a recent 0.7 driver public release by
Carlos Puchol (cpg@cs.utexas.edu), the original README is attached
below; please read it.

This version allows reading all channels in one go. It also fixes some
problems with the original.

Fly8 will by default access this driver; however, if you specify the
'game' option on the joystick line in fly.ini then it will use the
<linux/game.h> driver instead. You must define the correct option or the
reading will fail!

regards

------------------ original README ---------------------------------

This file describes how to install the joystick device driver version
0.7 for the Linux 1.0 kernel (or previous, if it has the loadable
modules).

This package includes the following files:

Makefile         - make file for package and test programs
README           - this README file
joystick-0.7.lsm - Linux Software map entry for this package
joystick.c       - The device driver itself
joystick.h       - The device driver include file
js.4             - man page
js.c             - test program
jscal.c          - calibration program

INSTALLATION:

You will need the modutils to load and remove loadable modules from
the kernel. They can be found in the kernel directories of the
Linux sites.

$ make joystick.o

Then in your rc.local insert a line like this:

$ insmod /conf/modules/joystick.o

(chose your own path for joystick.o, I have a conf dir for modules).
You can try this as well by becoming root.

If you have a kernel where it has the proper symbol table, you
shouldn't have problems. If not (quite likely for now, unfortunately),
then you will get an error similar to this:

$ insmod joystick.o
_xtime undefined
$

If that is the case, then you need to add those ``undefined'' calls to
the kernel symbol table in linux/kernel/ksyms.S, then remake the
kernel, save a backup of your current kernel, and reboot the new
kernel.

On bootup you should see a message displayed such as the following:

js_init: found 2 joysticks

To use the joystick driver, two files should be made in /dev. To do
this, go to the directory where the joystick distribution was
installed and do:

$ make devs

To test the driver, compile and run the programs "js" and "jscal" by
doing:

$ make all

The program "js" simply prints out the state of the buttons and
joystick values continuously.

The program "jscal" allows the joysticks to be calibrated to return
values between 0 and 0xff (or as close as can be done with
shifting).

To install the man page, do:

$ make man

The original joystick driver was written by Art Smith
(asmith@cbnewsd.att.com). Changes in version 0.6 were made by Jeff
Tranter (tranter@software.mitel.com). This version brought to you by
Carlos Puchol (cpg@cs.utexas.edu).

Changes from version 0.6 to 0.7
- Support for loadable modules

Changes from version 0.5 to 0.6:
- updated to work with 0.99pl15 kernel (and hopefully 1.0)
- wrote man page
- enhanced "js" and "jscal" programs
- various minor changes (indenting code, fixing typos, etc...)

One application that supports the joystick driver is the "fly8" flight
simulator program. Check any of the major Linux archive sites for the
latest version.
