            11..  IInnttrroodduuccttiioonn

            This program is a flight simulator. It puts more emphasis on
            the dynamics than on the cosmetics: just wire-frame. It  can
            run  on many machines as it was written for portability. The
            distribution includes support  for  msdos,  mswin  and  unix
            (used to work on Amiga but I have no access to one anymore).
            Other ports were done but I did received  any  sources  back
            yet.   On Intel based systems a 386DX is the minimum for any
            decent performance. A fast video controller is a boon as the
            program, when running on a 386DX/40Mhz, spends 70-80% of its
            time pushing pixels. On non-intel machines you can  try  and
            see if it is fast enough...

            As  of this release the msdos version requires a 386 or bet-
            ter. If I get enough requests then I will compile it for 286
            but it is too slow on such machines most of the time anyway.

            The program was written  for  fun.  I  borrowed  ideas  from
            everywhere  and  hope to hear some more. The design is based
            on a program I wrote more than 20  years  ago  at  uni  (the
            Technion).  I  had  an  excellent  coach (Danny Cohen) and I
            still have fond memories of those times. But now my computer
            has  more  than  24Kbytes of memory! so Fly8 is written in C
            (Fly8 was the name of the last version of the original  pro-
            gram  dated  12-JAN-1974, it was written in PDP15 assembly -
            macro15 - for a VT15 graphics processor).

            The actual purpose of this program is to give me an opportu-
            nity  to  experiment  with various aspects of flight simula-
            tion, but mostly with (1) the HUD symbology (or, more gener-
            aly,  with  man-machine interaction) and (2) the studying of
            basic aerodynamics (as well as general real time  simulation
            techniques). This explains why there are so many HUD options
            and such a proliferation of flight dynamics models, as  well
            as why the simulation parameters are user definable as input
            files at run time. Of course, the experimental nature of the

                                       _P_a_g_e _3



            program means that it must be distributed in source form.

            On  the  PC  the  basic  screen  drawing  uses  the standard
            Microsoft graphics library. It is OK but not very fast;  the
            main  advantage is that it will support most video adapters.
            The fast graphics driver was built from  the  routines  from
            DJGPP  with much personal additions. The flight dynamics was
            influenced by an SGI program I saw and ACM. The  timer  rou-
            tines  come from a microsoft journal article, the user-input
            routine (notice how you can use arrow keys etc? use up-arrow
            to retrieve history.. I will document it one day) comes from
            DDJ (or was it CUJ? author name is Bob Bybee). Well, I avoid
            re-inventing  wheels  unless it is fun. The program compiles
            with Microsoft C, Borland C, gcc on a  friend's  Amiga,  Sun
            and Linux and I hope on other platforms; it is written to be
            portable. It runs under MSDOS, MSWindows, Amiga and unix.

            What? what? WHAT? you want to see some action? OK. just skip
            to the next chapter then come back.

            The full set of commands is detailed in the 'commands' chap-
            ter. Here we will look at the program areas in general.

            There are two rather distinct kinds  of  commands  that  one
            uses:  commands  that drive (fly) the game and commands that
            configure, set options and so on (which are used  with  less
            urgency).  It  was  attempted  to get the important commands
            into the keyboard (a one keystroke command) while the others
            go  into  the  main menu system (accessed with the Esc key).
            Some of the urgent commands may bring up a  menu  which  you
            may ignore if you know the keystokes.

            The  urgent commands will control the vehicle flight and the
            other subsystems (radar, HUD, HDD, weapons etc.).  You  will
            notice  early that the program lacks the traditional instru-
            ment panel: it is intended to be driven  from  the  HUD  and
            other digital displays.

            The vehicle is also driven by a pointing device (a mouse or,
            preferably, a joystick). It will run off the keypad when you
            have  no such device.  The pointer is used only for steering
            control although the buttons  can  be  mapped  to  auxiliary
            functions.

            The  display area is typicaly divided into the main view and
            a number of secondary Head Down Displays (HDD).  The  design
            has  a dozen or so on-board instruments that generate visual
            data; you select which ones should  be  displayed  on  which
            HDD.  The main view is what you see through the cockpit. The
            HUD can be overlaid onto this view (as is the  case  with  a
            real  plane).  Other  data may also be shown here for conve-
            nience.

            One instrument is designated as an alternate main view  (use


            _V_e_r_s_i_o_n _1_._1_2                _F_L_Y_8            _F_l_i_g_h_t _S_i_m_u_l_a_t_o_r





                                       _P_a_g_e _4



            the  'v'  command to see it). The 'windows' menu handles the
            screen format and configuration.

            The program generates various messages  as  it  goes  along,
            these  will  appear at the bottom of the main view and stack
            up. Each message has a time-out for deletion but you can use
            'c'  to  clear the lot. When the program needs user input it
            will open a prompt line at the very bottom of the main  view
            (in  magenta  color)  where your data will show. You can use
            the normal editing keys while entering data here -  previous
            entries  are  accessible with the up/down arrows. See 'input
            line editing' later.

            You may find some of the commands/options  strange  (if  not
            outright  insane);  this  will  be  related  to  my taste or
            (mostly) to much history and quick fixing that did not  com-
            pletely  settle  yet.  I have looked at other programs (like
            F3, JF2, ACM and SGI f.s.) but this was after the first ver-
            sion of this program was finished, so some good ideas missed
            the bus this time. In the future I hope to polish  the  user
            interface  (especialy  after  other people get to use it and
            express an opinion).

            Being as the program is still evolving you  will  find  some
            areas less complete than others. I hope that there is enough
            of it to make it useful. I expect to see  contributions  (of
            ideas  and  code)  from  other  people;  I  will continue to
            develop the program (at least for a while) and would like to
            see it take it's own path in life [heavy stuff :-)].

            On  most  environments all you need to do is unpack the dis-
            tribution archive into your prefered directory and  you  are
            set. Make sure you un-archive the parts such that the direc-
            tory structure is maintained.  Refer to the README file  for
            specific instructions, you will probably want to enable sup-
            port for your graphics card (on MSDOS).

            Another thing you will want to do is  select  your  prefered
            pointing device (the joystick is best). Examine the examples
            in fly.ini and read the later chapter about the options.

            menu.

            Some commands are used only when the 'keypad' is selected as
            the pointing device for flying. Otherwise the  commands  are
            grouped here by their physical location and organized alpha-
            betically.

            The program usually runs  with  the  NumLock  engaged  which
            means  that the keypad keys duplicate the digits 0 through 9
            and the period '.'.

            There is no current facility to redefine the  usage  of  the
            keys  but  the keyboard macros can be of use here. See under
            F7/F8.

                      This is used for experimenting with  various  LCOS
                      formulae and will be gone once it settles down. At
                      this point the calculations are  based  on  linear
                      motions,  it  should  be modified to follow an arc
                      instead. The setting  is  shown  as  'Mn'  in  the

                      but  only effective when on the ground. In reality
                      these should not be operated at  high  speed  (use
                      speed  brakes  and reverse thrust for initial slow
                      down).

                 c    Clear text area. By now there is no text area any-
                      more so this is used for the auxiliary function of

                      turned off) then the plane will wander around  the
                      airport  perimeter.  If  there  are ground targets
                      then these will  be  chased  and  the  plane  will
                      crash!  This mode is activated by the command line
                      option 'z'. If the kill-mode is enabled ('k') then
                      the auto-pilot will fire at the target.

                 D    Descend the parachute. After you eject it may take
                      a while to get to the ground.  You  can  pass  the
                      time  by  looking  around (use the arrow and F5/F6
                      zoom keys), or you can jump to the  landing  phase
                      with  this  command. If you land before your plane
                      crashes then you will have to wait (a WAIT  notice
                      will be shown).

                 d    Declutter the HUD. This will remove some HUD items
                      that get in the way when you are  in  a  dogfight.
                      You  can  use  the  Hud.Parts  menu to selectively
                      remove HUD items.

                 E    Eject. If your plane is not  dead,  your  ejecting
                      will   send  it  crashing.   You  are  then  on  a
                      parachute descending slowly. Use 'D' for  a  quick
                      descent.

                 i    Intelligence: identify all visible  targets  (tog-
                      gle)  This  is what makes this program better than
                      the real thing... in this mode all visible targets
                      are  identified even when outside of the HUD area.
                      You need to have HUD data mode enabled to get info
                      about  the  targets.  The aiming reticule will not
                      show when in this mode.

                 j    Radar sees only real pilots (ignores drones) (tog-
                      gle).  The  program can generate drones for target
                      practice. If you want the radar  to  ignore  these
                      and  only  show  (and select) real planes then use
                      this command.  There are other  pilots  only  when
                      you are networked.

                      selected weapon will be fired at this  point.  The

                      should see a piper).

                 l    Lock target (toggle) The radar can operate in  two
                      modes,  either  it  continuously  selects a target
                      according to  the  designated  target  acquisition
                      mode or it stays locked on the current one. In the
                      locked mode, the first  selected  target  will  be
                      locked on and no more searching will be done. When
                      not locked the target designator will be shown  as
                      a  broken  box.  You  can  use the un-lock command
                      (usually attached to one of the buttons and to the
                      space-bar)  to  release  the  current  target  and
                      acquire a new one.

                      which will change  the  buttons  mode.  The  first
                      unrecognized character will terminate this command
                      (it is good practice to use the Esc key for that).

                           of this command.

                      Calibrate  pointer. Mainly for joystick. When Fly8
                      starts it sets the joystick to  an  'uncalibrated'
                      mode.  You  now  need  to play the stick to all of
                      it's positions, which means move the x  and  y  to
                      the edges, move the throttle to both ends and move
                      the FCS hat to all positions.  Finally  leave  the
                      stick centered, the throttle at the position which
                      you want to be the point where AB starts and leave
                      the hat centered. Now hit 'x' and the program will
                      re-calibrate itself.

                      After playing for a while you can  again  hit  'x'
                      but you will have to take your hards off the stick
                      and reposition the throttle before doing  so  (and
                      you  MUST have played for a while so that the full
                      extent of the controls was used).

            The function keys are normally used in plain mode (no Shift,
            Alt  or  Ctrl).  When  the menu is on the up-front, the left
            column ten selections are accessible with F1-F10  while  the
            right column uses AltF1-AltF10.

                      and the joystick trigger button.

                      window).

                 F7   Macro/HotKey definition.  Any key can be used  for
                      a macro name (except F7/F8). If you define a macro
                      for a HotKey (Ctrl- and Alt- 'a' thru 'z') then it
                      can  be played back with one keystroke. Other keys
                      are played using the F8 key.  If you use  a  Macro
                      during  recording then the Macro will be recorded.
                      If you later re-define this  Macro  then  it  will
                      affect  any  other  Macros  that  uses it.  During
                      macro expansion there is a limit of 16  levels  of
                      nesting.   There is no capability for Macros defi-

                                          then  you  are   prompted   by

                                          may respond by F8  (abort  the

            A menu has a list of options, each associated with a key and
            a  function.   To  select a function use the Up/Dn arrows to
            highlight it and then Enter, or directly  press  the  corre-
            sponding  key.  When on the up-front, the associated letters
            are NOT shown but are  recognized;  use  the  CtrlF-keys  to
            select  left  column  functions  and AltF-keys for the right
            column. See under HDD later.

            Menus can be nested, in which case the  previous  selections
            are  listed  first  (in  a staggered fasion and highlighted)
            followed by the current menu. The selected option  is  high-
            lighted (white) while the others are displayed in gray.

            The  Esc  key  brings  up  the top menu but later is used to
            abort a menu.  During menu navigation use these keys:

                 Esc
                      aborts the menu

                 Enter
                      accept the current selection option

                 other
                      select the corresponding option

            If a command is invalid (top/bottom  of  list  or  undefined
            option)  then a beep is emited and the keystroke is ignored.

            The menu system is changing rapidly so the following may  be
            incomplete.

            Some  other  commands  may  pop  up a menu, in which case it
            behaves in a similar way.

            If you have the up-front instrument active  then  the  menus
            will  appear  on  it rather than on the main menu. This is a
            stupid attempt to make your interaction look similar to what
            happens  in  a modern fighter. It is often the case that the
            pilot has a panel which can display about  10  alpha-numeric
            words  in  bright white (daylight readable). These will usu-
            ally use special LEDs and a more  elaborate  font  than  the
            7-seg  digits  (9  segment?).  There  are pushbuttons beside
            these words. The words are arranged  in  two  columns,  each
            with  10  words,  with 10 buttons on the right and 10 on the
            left. As you press a button new  information  is  displayed.
            Other  planes  use  a  real  CRT  but still have a 5-buttons
            arrangement (mostly on all four sides, totaling 20).

            In Fly8 the up-front device has two columns of  words,  each
            column  can  show  10  words, each word can be 10 characters
            long. There are 10 buttons  on  the  left  (Ctrl-F1  through
            Ctrl-F10)  and 10 on the right (Alt-F1 through Alt-F10). Use
            these keys to make selections. You can still use the  normal
            command letters (if you know them, as they are not displayed
            here) as well as move about with the Up/Down keys:  a  small
            dash between the key number and the text identifies the cur-
            rently selected option.

            Various objects can be created with this menu. These objects
            are used as targets.

                 Emit.target
                      create one random target

                 del  delete all targets

                 Emit.gtarget

                      create one random plane (drone)

                 del  delete all drones. This will also set  the  number
                      of automatic drones to zero.

                 Emit.drones
                      specify  how  many  drones should be automatically
                      maintained in  the  air.   Whenever  one  is  lost
                      another one takes off.

            Various aspects of the HUD can be set. Each option is either
            set,  reset  or toggled. The default is to toggle the option
            but the first three menu items can be used  to  change  this
            mode.  This  menu can be accessed from the main menu as well
            as directly with the 'u' command. The  following  selections
            appear on many of the sub-menus:

                 0 turn off     turn option off

                 1 turn on      turn option  on

                 2 toggle       toggle option on/off

            This  top  level  menu  will  bring up a number of sub-menus
            which are described further down this doco.

                 HUD.off
                      turn the HUD off. When turned off, the radar  sym-
                      bols  will  still  show.  This is a feature of the
                      game which is not like the real thing;  it  allows
                      you  to play with a very clean view. Not only will
                      the radar stuff still show, but the  symbols  will
                      now move freely across the full screen rather than
                      being confined to the HUD area. To get rid of  the
                      reticle/TDB use the 'parts' menu.

                 HUD.on
                      turn the HUD on

                 HUD.type
                      Select  HUD  style.  Although the styles are named
                      after planes, each  plane  actualy  displays  many
                      styles depending on the mode of operation.

                 HUD.parts
                      The  HUD has many components. This sub-menu allows
                      you to choose which are included in the  HUD  dis-
                      play.  Selecting  a  HUD  type  will automatically
                      adjust these  to  what  is  appropriate  for  that
                      style.

                 HUD.options1
                      This  (and  the  next) selection allows you to set
                      some parameters which modify the appearance of the
                      HUD. The most often used ones are in this sub-menu
                      and the rest are in the next.

                 HUD.options2
                      See description of "options 1" above.

                 HUD.radar
                      This will configure the  radar  symbology  on  the
                      HUD.

                 HUD.ils
                      Will  let you select the ILS beacon. In the future
                      there should be  a  more  elaborate  NAV  facility
                      instead.

                 HUD.hdd
                      This  menu is now changing as a new hdd (head down
                      display) system is being implemented.

                 HUD.help
                      Display the full hud setup options list.

            Fly8 supports a number of HUD styles. The name  of  the  hud
            does not necessarily correspond with the plane type but this
            is what I found on the various videos that I saw. If anybody
            has  more  knowledge or can provide other detail PLEASE feel
            free to advice me.

                 HUD.type.Classic
                      This one I made up before seeing any real HUD. The
                      basic  data  is  laid close to the edge and leaved
                      most of the area free from obstruction. My  origi-
                      nal  aiming  reticule was 8 dots in a circle but I
                      discontinued it in favour or the more common piper
                      style.  The  numerals  on  the pitch ladder do not
                      rotate and the  fast  font  is  used.  On  a  slow
                      machine  this  hud (especially in low detail) will
                      perform much faster that any other.

                 HUD.type.FA18
                      This HUD does not use tapes for the  altitude  and
                      speed. The pitch ladder is narrower than usual and
                      slanted toward the horizon. A good feature is  the


            _V_e_r_s_i_o_n _1_._1_2                _F_L_Y_8            _F_l_i_g_h_t _S_i_m_u_l_a_t_o_r





                                       _P_a_g_e _2_7



                      fact  that  the pitch ladder stays always in view:
                      if the velocity vector goes off the screen (easily
                      done  on  the FA-18 which has no trouble flying at
                      high AOAs) the pitch ladder  adopts  (temporarily)
                      the waterline mark. Another feature is the closure
                      speed which is shown under the piper  rather  than
                      on  a  radar ranging scale. Optionally, a pendulum
                      (or what do you call it?) can be  displayed  which
                      shows  you your roll angle with good resolution up
                      to 45 Degrees either way. This is a wide angle hud
                      - 20 degrees side to side.

                 HUD.type.F16
                      This  HUD  uses  simple  scales (no baseline). The
                      heading scale can be at the top or at the  bottom.

                 HUD.type.F15
                      This  HUD is probably used for air to air on other
                      planes. The speed scale is upside-down. The  head-
                      ing  scale  can be set to two different positioned
                      at the top.

                 HUD.type.Ether
                      A new HUD type now being developed.

            The various HUD symbols can  be  individually  selected  for
            display.

                 HUD.parts.ladder
                      Select pitch ladder (and related) options.

                 HUD.parts.altitude
                      Show altitude scale (or box).

                 HUD.parts.speed
                      Show speed scale (or box).

                 HUD.parts.heading
                      Show heading scale.

                 HUD.parts.border
                      Show the HUD border (in gray color).

                 HUD.parts.vv
                      Show the plane's velocity vector. A must for accu-
                      rate flying.

                 HUD.parts.vw
                      This activates a mode that the FA18 uses: when the
                      vv  goes  off screen, a waterline mark will appear
                      and the pitch ladder  will  be  drawn  around  it.
                      This  way  the  ladder  never  goes completely off

                 HUD.parts.plus
                      Show a 'plus' sign at the center of the screen.

                 HUD.parts.pointer
                      Show  a  small (red) mark that tracks the joystick
                      (or mouse or whatever pointing device you  use).

                 HUD.parts.beta
                      Show the sideslip angle (beta) on FA18 style.

                 HUD.parts.ground
                      Brings up  a  menu  of  ground  proximity  related
                      options.

                 HUD.parts.director
                      Show  the flight director. This is part of the new
                      ether HUD still under development.

                 HUD.parts.waypoint
                      Will show the target as a  diamond  along  with  a
                      small  pointer  near  the FPM pointing at it. This
                      small pointer represents  a  top  view  where  the
                      small circle is the pointer base and the line from
                      it marks the direction of the target. When ILS  is
                      active  it  is  that point that will be tracked by
                      these symbols.

                 HUD.parts.tracers
                      This shows a 'string' hanginf off your  boresight,
                      which  represents the bullets position if you were
                      firing. Horizontal marks indicate interval of 1500
                      feet,  and a small bead marks the target distance.
                      This tool is useful for gun shots when  the  radar
                      is shut down.

                 HUD.parts.ghost
                      The  Flight  Path  Marker is caged. A ghost FPM is
                      shown if the caging shifts the FPM by more than  1
                      degree. It looks like the FPM but without the cen-
                      tral circle.

                 HUD.parts.truehead
                      The Heading scale is normally calibrated  to  show
                      about  30  degrees.  However, you may prefer it to
                      span directly correspond to the world view through
                      the HUD. In this way, an object that is 10 degrees
                      left of the HUD center will  really  be  indicated
                      with  a  10  degrees  offset on the heading scale.

            regarding the pitch ladder and associated symbols.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.ladder
                      Enables the display of the pitch ladder.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.pinned
                      In  this mode the ladder it always attached to the
                      HUD center (waterline mark).

                 HUD.parts.ladder.right
                      The numbers on the ladder steps are displayed only
                      on the right wing.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.erect
                      The  numbers  are  displayed  erected. The default
                      will rotate the numbers with the ladder.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.color
                      In this mode the positive steps are blue  and  the
                      negative are red.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.funnel
                      The  step  tips  are  displayed  in the middle gap
                      instead, which gives it a funnel shape.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.slant
                      The steps are slanted rather than flat. The  slant
                      increases  with the pitch angle, reaching to about
                      45 degrees.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.zenith
                      Will display a zenith/nadir marker. It is a  small
                      circle  for the zenith and a similar circle with a
                      cross inside for the nadir.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.under
                      The numerals are displayed under the  step  rather
                      than beside it.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.tip0
                      Specifies  that  you want a tip to be displayed on
                      the zero pitch (horizon) ladder step.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.hold
                      This is  a  temporary  option  that  controls  the
                      behaviour  of  the  program when the pitch is very
                      high such that some standard  calculations  cannot
                      be  carried out. By default it freezes the heading
                      and allows the roll angle to vary.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.h
                      This controls another aspect of the  behaviour  as
                      described  in  the  previous option. It causes the
                      roll  angle  to  freeze  while  the  heading  will

                      continue to reflect your attitude.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.sun
                      Shows  a  sun  symbol,  a small white circle which
                      stays on the HUD edge  when  the  sun  is  out  of
                      sight.  It actually follows the zenith rather that
                      the real sun and is intended as an aid in recover-
                      ing your situational awareness.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.negtip
                      This  indicates  that  the  step  tips will always
                      point toward the nadir.  The default is  to  point
                      toward the horizon.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.sizes
                      Brings up a menu for setting the sizes of the lad-
                      der features.

            _5_._7_._4  _H_U_D_._p_a_r_t_s_._l_a_d_d_e_r_._s_i_z_e_s _m_e_n_u
            These options specify the sizes of the pitch  ladder  parts.
            The  size  is  a  relative  number with a value from 0 (size
            zero) to 16384 (full HUD width). A resize menu will come  up
            which will allow you to modify the size using the '+' or '-'
            options (increase/decrease) or using the '=' option (you can
            then  enter  a new value). Use the '*' option to restore the
            value to what it was at the start (but when  you  exit  this
            menu the new value is final).

                 HUD.parts.ladder.sizes.gap
                      The width of the gap in the middle of each step.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.sizes.step
                      The width of each ladder step.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.sizes.horizon
                      The size of the horizon step in flight.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.sizes.land
                      The size of the horizon step when the landing gear
                      is lowered.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.sizes.tip
                      The size of the step tip.

                 HUD.parts.ladder.sizes.ndash
                      The number of dashes that make a single step  (one
                      side of it).

            _5_._7_._5  _H_U_D_._p_a_r_t_s_._g_r_o_u_n_d _m_e_n_u
            These  options  modify  some  aspects  of the HUD appearance
            regarding ground proximity.

                 HUD.parts.ground.gnd ptr
                      The ground pointer is a  marker  that  shows  your

                      bank  (roll) angle. It is represented by an arrow-
                      head which slides along a set of angle marks.  The
                      highest angle marked is 45 degrees.

                 HUD.parts.ground.Xbreak
                      Show  the X-break symbol if at risk of hitting the
                      ground. This symbol is a large, blinking, X symbol
                      in  the  center of the HUD. If you get even closer
                      to impact then a PULL UP message will  be  flashed
                      and a high pitch warning will sound.

                 HUD.parts.ground.Xvar
                      In  this  mode  the X-break symbol starts with two
                      angle-brackets (like '> <' that get closer towards
                      the HUD center as the impact gets nearer.  It then
                      merges into a single X shaped symbol.

                      The default mode always shows the X shaped symbol,
                      regardless of the time to impact.

                 HUD.parts.ground.Xgrid
                      Show  the  warning  grid if at risk of hitting the
                      ground. This is a red grid which will overlay  the
                      ground  if you fly too low. This experimental mode
                      is attempting to assist you in regaining awareness
                      of your situation when there are not enough groung
                      features in view.

                 HUD.parts.ground.pullup
                      A pullup cue will be displayed. It  indicated  the
                      dive  angle  at which you will hit the ground in 5
                      seconds. When a bomb weapon is selected  a  safety
                      distance  of 200 meters is set to protect you from
                      the explosion.

                      The pullup cue looks like an  extra  pitch  ladder
                      step  (usually  narrower),  with  upwards  slanted
                      tips.

            These options modify some aspects of the HUD appearance.

                 HUD.options1.heading
                      The heading scale shows the  planes  heading.  The
                      numbers  displayed  are  in  the  range 000-350 in
                      increments of  10.  This  option  selects  between
                      showing  the full 3 digits or using an abbreviated
                      form. The abbreviated form will only show the  top
                      two digits (09 for 90 and 27 for 270). The Classic
                      HUD style will show the full  number  but  without
                      the leading zeros.

                 HUD.options1.knots
                      Internally  all  data  is  stored  in meters. This


            _V_e_r_s_i_o_n _1_._1_2                _F_L_Y_8            _F_l_i_g_h_t _S_i_m_u_l_a_t_o_r





                                       _P_a_g_e _3_2



                      option requests that all  numbers  use  knots/feet
                      (as  appropriate)  instead.  It is the default for
                      the standard HUDs.

                 HUD.options1.top
                      This will further modify the  heading  scale.  The
                      scale  will  show  at  the  top  or  at the bottom
                      depending on this option. For the FA18 HUD  style,
                      this  option  will  cause  a base-line to be drawn
                      under the scale (the scale will stay  at  the  top
                      regardless).

                 HUD.options1.fine
                      For  some of the scales this option will show more
                      detail. The standard detail  is  to  show  a  tick
                      every  5  units.  The fine detail will show a tick
                      every two units.

                 HUD.options1.xfine
                      This is a further refinement of the  above  'fine'
                      level and will show a tick for each scale unit.

                 HUD.options1.big
                      [obsolete]The   name  is  completely  wrong.  This
                      option defines the  style  of  the  ticks  on  the
                      scales  (for some of the HUDs only). The usual way
                      is to have the ticks go from the base-line to  the
                      outside.  In  the  'big'  style  the scale will be
                      along the edge with the ticks towards the  inside.

                 HUD.options1.scale
                      This  defines the number of units along the scale.
                      This affects only the Classic HUD. The more units,
                      the longer the scales.

                 HUD.options1.area
                      The  HUD  has  a fixed area (measured in field-of-
                      view degrees). You can alter this size. Note  that
                      although  the  HUD  size  changes  when  you  zoom
                      in/out, it still keeps the same FOV.  This  option
                      defines  how  many  degrees are from the center to
                      the edge of the HUD (all HUDs are square).

                 HUD.options1.cas
                      The speed show will be the  'calibrated  airspeed'
                      rather  than  the  'true airspeed'. A snall 'T' or
                      'C' will mark the type of speed shown.

            These options modify some aspects  of  the  HUD  appearance.
            These are the less used options.

                 HUD.options2.a alarm
                      Enable  aural alarms. If you hate the GLIMIT beeps

                      etc. then use this option  to  turn  these  alarms
                      off.

                 HUD.options2.v alarm
                      This  will  Enable/disable  the visual alarms that
                      show on the HUD.

                      Select  the  stroke  font  size. A size of 8 means
                      'use the default' and all other sizes are relative
                      to  8.  The  default is calculated from the screen
                      resolution.

            options.

                 HUD.radar.corner
                      Radar target data can be at the bottom-left corner
                      of the HUD or can follow the target designator.

                      Request to show target data.

                 HUD.radar.distance
                      Request to show  target  distance  in  intel  mode
                      (mainly used in the radar/map modes).

                 HUD.radar.name
                      Request  to show target type in intel mode (mainly
                      used in the radar/map modes).

                      Show target acceleration vector as a  hand  inside
                      the reticle piper.

                 HUD.radar.reticle
                      Show aiming reticle piper.

                 HUD.radar.target
                      Show the target designator.

                 HUD.radar.ross
                      Use  Ross's  method  for  the aiming reticle. This
                      mode will show a small box in front of the  target
                      where  it is expected to be when a bullet hits it.
                      If you aim the reticle at this box and shoot  then
                      you should hit the target.

                      Unlike  real  HUDs,  the radar symbols can be dis-
                      played all over the screen rather that just inside
                      the  HUD  area.  'limit' will specify which way it
                      should be.

                 HUD.radar.thick
                      This is an experimental option to draw  the  radar
                      reticle thicker.

                 HUD.radar.hidetgt
                      When  active,  if  the TD box is under the reticle
                      then it is not shown.  This de-clutters  the  area
                      of interest.

                 HUD.radar.tpointer
                      If  the target is off the HUD then a line is drawn
                      from the boresightpoint (the '+' at the view  cen-
                      ter)  towards the target. The distance to the tar-
                      get is shown digitally: this is the angle  of  the
                      target  relative  to  the boresight direction: 180
                      means it is exactly behind you, 90 means it is  on
                      your side (ANY side, right, left, above or below).
                      It should be read as: if you turn so many  degrees
                      in the direction of the pointer then you will have
                      the target straight in front.

                 HUD.radar.vpointer
                      This will modify  the  'tpointer'  such  that  the
                      length  of  the  pointer will vary with the target
                      relative angle.

            Fly8 supports a number of HDD devices. This menu allows  you
            to set these up with various options. It is still under con-
            struction.

                 HUD.HDD.instruments
                      Show the instruments panel. This is a  very  basic
                      (and  rather useless by now) instruments depiction
                      that will be overlayed at the bottom right of  the
                      main window.

            These options enable some augmentation systems which  modify
            the behaviour of some controls.

                 Auto.Flaps
                      Enables  the  flaps  Control  Augmentation  System
                      (CAS). This will give you better turn  performance
                      by  adding  flaps  (or  leading  edge  flaps) when
                      needed).

                 Auto.Elevators
                      This will enable the CAS which limits  the  Eleva-
                      tors  sensitivity at high speed to avoid excessive
                      load. A Stability  Augmentation  System  (SAS)  is
                      being  added which will improve dynamic pitch sta-
                      bility by taking some authority  over  the  eleva-
                      tors.

                 Auto.Rudder
                      Enable  the  rudder  SAS  and  CAS.  It is not yet
                      implemented.

                 Debug.debug
                      Enable the general debug mode. Some programs  will
                      display  internal  data  when  in  this mode. This
                      changes a lot and cannot be documented.

                 Debug.Trace
                      Enable  debugging  trace.  Useful  for  developers
                      only.

                 Debug.gp w
                      General  purpose  debug  option W is controlled by
                      this option. It is used for debugging  and  cannot
                      be  documented  here,  see if there is anything in
                      the readme.

            recognized  by the pointer driver and reported back to Fly8.
            It is now up to the program to react to the  button  status.
            If  a  button press command is associated with a key then it
            will be issued when the button press status  is  recognized.
            If  the button was set to release mode then when you release
            the button a command may be sent too.

            You use this menu to define the modes that a button responds
            to.   The   actual   command   associated   with   a  button
            press/release is defined by including, in  fly.max,  a  line
            like:

            Some simple commands toggle between options. This  makes  it
            impossible  to  use  a macro for setting these commands to a
            pre-determined state. The commands menu  allows  you  to  do
            just so. Select 'On', Off' or 'Toggle' then hit another com-
            mand. Now it will follow the earlier setting rather than the
            default 'Toggle' behaviour.

            When  a  command  needs to receive a parameter which is more
            than one keystroke it uses a line input facility. It  allows
            you  to  use history and editing. You can use the arrow keys
            and insert/delete keys to move about and edit your response.
            The  up/down  keys  will retrieve history.  Finally you will
            need to press Enter for the program to accept the input.  If
            you  key the start of a line and hit PgUp then a search will
            be done for a previous entry with the same beginning.

            The history queue has 20 entries, all input  requests  share
            this same queue.

              -- you fire a weapon

              -- you hit a target, or a plane crashes

              -- the radar locks onto a (new) target

            These are highlighted words flashed onto the HUD. They  vary
            in size and blink rate.

                 WAIT      You ejected and landed but your plane did not
                           yet crash. This one does not  relate  to  the
                           HUD, all the others only show when the HUD is
                           on.

                 STALL     You are flying the plane too slow to maintain
                           lift  or you are turning too sharply at a too
                           high angle of attack.

                 GLIMIT    You exceeded the maximum acceptable  G  force
                           of  your  body  (+9G to -3G), or you exceeded
                           the 10G plane structure limit.

                 FUEL      You have less than 10% fuel  left.  The  less
                           fuel  you have the faster the message blinks,
                           then it finally stays on.

                 PULL UP   You are about to hit the  ground  unless  you
                           pull  the plane up immediately. If the danger
                           is higher then a red ground grid  is  flashed
                           to  give  the pilot better orientation (there
                           is not enough scenery to build proper  visual
                           awareness).

            This chapter explains in detail how planes  are  handled  in
            this program.

            The  plane is controlled by your pointing device, preferably
            a joystick.  The basic  controls  will  have  the  following
            effect:

            Left/right  controls  will cause the plane to roll. The roll
            will continue while the controls are engaged. When the  joy-
            stick  is  centered the rolling will stop and the plane will
            stay in the current situation. If  you  want  to  fly  level
            after rolling to the right then you will have to do the fol-
            lowing:

              -- roll right (the horizon will roll left).

              -- stop rolling (the horizon will stay at a fixed  angle).

              -- roll left (horizon rolling back to the right).

              -- stop rolling (when the horizon is level).

            As the plane has momentum, the response is not immediate and
            you will have to get a feel for it.

            To start climbing you will pull the stick toward  you  until
            the climb angle is what you want and then release the stick.
            The plane will continue climbing until  you  push  the  nose
            down  for  level  flight. If you are rolled over to one side
            then the pulling will cause the  plane  to  turn  into  that
            side. If you are upside-down and you pull the stick then you
            will start descending towards the ground.  In  other  words:
            the  up/down controls (elevators) are used for any change of
            direction, both left/right and up/down.

            To turn right, first roll right, then pull the  stick  until
            the  desired  heading is reached, then release the elevators
            and roll back to level flight. Of course, due to gravity and
            plane  dynamics  any change in situation will probably cause
            the plane to move in a direction slighly different from what
            the  controls  suggest  - you should learn to compensate for
            this. The flight-path-marker (the little circle  with  three
            wings)  tells  you  where  the  plane is heading and this is
            hardly ever the direction where your plane is pointed at.

            To control your engine you set the  throttle  with  the  9/3
            keys.  The  throttle  can  be set to between -100% and 100%.
            Reverse setting only works on the ground. Each keystroke  is
            5% change. The 1 key will set the throttle to 100% and the 0
            key to 0%. The planes speed will pick up slowly (depends  on
            the planes weight and the engines power). You can engage the

            after-burner with the '.' key. To slow down you may use  the
            speed brakes ('+' key).

            About  the  AfterBurner:  light  it  with '.' (will also set
            throttle to 100%). Then each '.' or '3' (power-up) will  add
            a  notch.  Each  '9' (power-down) will take it down a notch.
            There are five steps (say 20% each).  The  throttle  display
            will show '103' for '100% + AB3', 105 is full AB. The engine
            display will show thrust in % of  mil  thrust  (full  AB  is
            about 150%-160%). If you use '1' (max throttle) or '0' (idle
            engine) the ab is turned off. NOTE that  AB5  uses  about  6
            times as much fuel as MIL for 60% extra power!

            Note  that with the PC keyboard and the NumLock engaged, the
            above keys appear in a logical order.

            The Classic plane is an over-simplified vehicle. It  has  no
            momentum  and no aerodynamics characteristics, it goes where
            you point it and is a good way to get the hang of  the  con-
            trols.  It  will never crash either (you can fly underground
            of course). But don't get too used to it, real planes handle
            very  differently  (the  Classic  is  more like a weightless
            spaceship of an arcade-game).

            The program displays a number of HUD styles. These are named
            according  to  a plane type but this is just because I first
            saw this HUD on a video tape dedicated  to  that  plane.  In
            reality each plane has a number of HUD modes. You can change
            the HUD style through the hud menu regardless of  the  plane
            type.

            The  HUD  is a piece of glass that is positioned at an angle
            in front of the pilot. The pilot looks through it to see the
            front  view  from the cockpit and at the same time a reflec-
            tion of a video screen is seen (this CRT is  in  the  'dash-
            board'  facing  up).  The  dual-image is similar to when one
            looks outside through a window at night and sees  a  reflec-
            tion  of  some  part of the room as well as the outside. The
            HUD can be displayed by itself on one of the auxiliary  HDDs
            (sometimes  refered to as the 'HUD repeater'), which is use-
            ful when the HUD optics is not operational (damaged).

            In practice, the HUD is a flat  image  superimposed  on  the
            front view, and it uses a special (usually green but you can
            change this) color. It does not  cover  the  full  field-of-
            view.

            The  image  projected  onto  the  HUD  contains two kinds of
            information. One type is data that the pilot will  otherwise


            _V_e_r_s_i_o_n _1_._1_2                _F_L_Y_8            _F_l_i_g_h_t _S_i_m_u_l_a_t_o_r





                                       _P_a_g_e _4_4



            have  to  look  for in some cockpit instruments (thus taking
            his eye off the outside scene); this  is  simply  a  way  of
            putting  the  most  important  information  if  front of the
            pilot. An example is the display of plane speed.  The  other
            kind  is  information  directly related to the outside image
            and meaningfull only in  relation  to  it,  for  example:  a
            bounding box is displayed such that it coincides with a vis-
            ible target that the radar is locked on.

            The prominent features on the HUD are  a  number  of  scales
            which  are  usually  diaplayed along the edge. Sometimes the
            detail of the scales  can  be  controlled  in  three  levels
            through the Hud menu (see there).

            The  HUD  symbols will relate to flight data or to auxiliary
            systems (weapons, radar, fuel etc.). The data related to the
            flying of the plane is described first.

            Your  compass.  It  will be shown as a horizontal ruler that
            moves as you turn. The current  heading  is  marked  with  a
            'tick'  or  a  'V'. It can be at the top or at the bottom of
            the HUD (Top option in Hud menu). North  is  360,  South  is
            180,  East  is  90  and West 270. Some modes do not show the
            trailing zero (270 is shown as 27) and NO, there is no  sup-
            port for radians or other units...

            Your  height  above sea level, a vertical ruler at the right
            edge of the HUD. It may  be  accompanied  by  a  second  bar
            (immediately  to  its left) that shows your climb/fall rate.
            This ruler moves up and down as the plane moves, the current
            altitude  is  to  be  read at the 'tick' in its middle. High
            altitudes show in thousands (with a possible decimal  point)
            while  low  ones  will show exact. The FA-18 style HUD shows
            the altitude in a box at the right side of the HUD with  the
            climb rate above it. Some HUDs will show a radar-range scale
            adjacent to (and to the left of) the  altitude  scale.  This
            will  indicate  the  distance  to the target (the full scale
            range is shown just above this  scale)  as  a  sliding  tick
            while the target closure speed is shown inside the tick.

            Climb rate is in meters (or feet) per minute!

            1100..33  SSppeeeedd

            Your  speed is shown as a ruler at the left edge of the HUD,
            a tick marks the current value. The FA-18 style HUD shows it
            in  the  left  box.  Some HUDs do not show the trailing zero
            while others show have the scale run from top to bottom.

            This information may be in meters/kmh of feet/knots (use the

            The orientation of the plane is displayed as a ladder,  each
            step relates to a different pitch. The steps are always par-
            allel to the horizon. Each step  is  marked  with  a  number
            which is your pitch angle (90 degrees is straight up, -90 is
            down and zero is level).  The  step's  angle  represent  the
            planes  roll. When you are upside-down the steps are too, as
            you roll the steps turn in the opposite way  to  follow  the
            horizon.  The negative-pitch steps (when you are going down)
            are dashed while the positive ones are solid. Small winglets
            at  the tips of the steps point toward the ground. The zero-
            pitch step is larger and is your artifical  horizon  if  you
            cannot  see  the  real  one. The FA-18 style HUD tries a bit
            harder by bending the steps toward the  ground:  the  higher
            your  pitch the larger the slant. It also shows a small cir-
            cle at the straight up/down directions (the down one  has  a
            cross through it).

            Although  the  pitch ladder follows the horizon (meaning the
            zero-step is on the horizon) there is some freedom in  where
            on  the horizon  to show it. Unless you disable the velocity
            vector (flight path) marker (see below), the ladder will  be
            centered  on  it.  This means that at a high angle of attack
            the pitch ladder may be out of view (as will the vv).

            In the case of the FA18, if the vv goes out of view  then  a
            waterline marker will appear at the center of the HUD (it is
            a W marker in a fixed position) and the  ladder  will  shift
            (smoothly) toward it. Once the vv is back in view the ladder
            will return to it and the waterline mark will disappear (the
            transitions take about two seconds maximum). The FA18 ladder
            shows an extra-long zero-step  while  the  landing  gear  is
            down.

            A plane rarely moves straight ahead due to gravity and aero-
            dynamic forces. This marker  (sometimes  called  the  'plane
            symbol')  is  a tiny circle with wings on either side and at
            the top (it is a stylized shape of a plane from behind).  At
            any  time, this marker shows you where the plane is heading.
            You will most of the time use this marker as a reference for
            flying  the  plane. The center of the view is rather useless
            for flying (you can bring up a cross-hair with the 'u+' com-
            mand)  but  can  be  helpful  in  aiming  the cannon (in the
            absence of the aiming reticle).

            The Classic plane always goes ahead, so the vv will be fixed
            at  the  center  of the HUD. By default it will not be shown
            for this plane.

            This is a 'W' that shows in the straight ahead point on  the
            front  view  (this  is not always the physical center of the
            HUD). It comes on whenever the landing gear is lowered.  The
            FA-18  HUD  shows it whenever the Velocity Vector is outside
            the HUD.

            When the radar is active, some symbols related to its opera-
            tion  are displayed. The main features are the target desig-
            nator box and the aiming reticle (the Piper).

            _1_0_._7_._1  _T_a_r_g_e_t _d_e_s_i_g_n_a_t_o_r
            This is a square that is centered on the target. If the tar-
            get  is  not locked then the box will have only corners. The
            target should be visible inside the box, unless  it  is  off
            screen. When off screen, the box has a '+' through it and it
            crawls along the HUD edge showing you  the  direction  where
            the  target is. If the target is actualy behind you then the
            '+' is replaced with an 'X'.

            If a target is close enough (within weapon  range)  then  an
            aiming  reticle  appears.   The  reticle is a circle with 12
            ticks. Each tick represent a distance of 1000 to the  target
            and  the  range  is  marked with a tick that moves along the
            inside edge of the reticle. A tick at  11  o'clock  means  a
            distance of 11,000 etc. You should fly the plane so that the
            center of the reticle (has a dot) is on the target and  then
            shoot  (actually,  the  cannon/radar  computer  will display
            'shoot' above the reticle when you have a good aim). If this
            sounds  simple  it  is because it is a simple procedure; the
            problem is that in order to get the target  in  the  reticle
            you  will  NOT  be  flying  the plane directly toward it. In
            practice you forget about where the plane should go and play
            a  game  of follow-the-target with the reticle (just try and
            not hit the ground).

            The F16 will also show a  'hand'  inside  the  circle  which
            indicates the direction and magnitude of the target acceler-
            ation (this one is very jiterry at times). You can turn this
            hand on/off with the Hud menu "acc vect" command.

            The FA18 HUD shows the closure speed outside the lower right
            side of the reticle. The F15/F16 shows the same  information
            on the radar range scale (beside the altitude) marked with a
            large '>' symbol. The closure speed measures  how  fast  you
            are catching up (positive) with the target.

            However,  in  order to complicate the situation we have some
            variations possible:



            _V_e_r_s_i_o_n _1_._1_2                _F_L_Y_8            _F_l_i_g_h_t _S_i_m_u_l_a_t_o_r





                                       _P_a_g_e _4_7



            There is an alternate piper: Ross's reticle. This is a  dif-
            ferent  aiming  method altogether. A square reticle is shown
            with only the corners visible. It is ahead of your target at
            all  times  on  its  projected position. You have to aim the
            piper at the box and then shoot. With this one  you  do  not
            care  where  the  real  target  is  because  the  aiming box
            replaces it. The piper will be fixed at the  center  of  the
            HUD.   You  may  want to turn off the target designator with
            'ut'.

            The target designator and aiming reticle are part of the HUD
            display,  however  you may choose to ignore this and request
            that these use the full screen.  Use  the  'uL'  command  to

            The radar measures the distance and relative (closure) speed
            of  the  target. The range is shown as an extra scale on the
            right side on the HUD  while  the  closure  speed  is  shown
            beside  the  '>' mark on it. The FA18 HUD does not show this
            scale but shows the closure speed under  the  piper  with  a
            'Vc' mark.

            When  a  target is selected, some digital information may be
            displayed (it can be disabled by the hud/radar  menu).  This
            data  shows at the left bottom corner of the HUD and has the
            following items:

              -- distance to target (units or k's with one decimal)

              -- closure speed (meters/knots)

              -- time to meet (seconds with one decimal).

              -- target type or pilot name

            When the target is in range the time shown is  bullet  time-
            to-impact rather than plane flight time.

            If  the  Corner  option  is not selected (uC) then this data
            will show under the target designator box. If the target  is
            too close to the bottom then the data may show above it.

            If  you activate the Intel mode (i) then all visible targets
            get a box with the following data (the MAP and RADAR diplays
            always have this mode):

              -- distance to target (units or k's with one decimal)

              -- target type or pilot name

            You  can use 'un' to disable the display of the second line.

            In addition to the above features, the HUD may show the fol-
            lowing:

            The  FA18  type HUD shows as standard, on the left low edge,
            the angle of attack (aoa), the mach number and  the  pilot's
            vertical  Gs.  The  selected weapon (and available units) is
            displayed at the low center of the HUD.

            The F15/F16 HUD shows the aoa at the  top  right  above  the
            altitude  scale.  The weapon selected is shown at the top of
            the data list ('XXX' means none selected)




            1111..  TThhee IILLSS

            The Instrument Landing System (ILS) is a  system  that  pro-
            vides enough information about your approach to guide you to
            the touchdown point with great  accuracy.  The  system  com-
            prises  two  separate  facilities:  the Localizer beam which
            tells you how well you are aligned with the runway  and  the
            Glide  Path  beam  which monitors your descent rate. The two
            components measure your approach error and display it as two
            bars.

            The  Localizer  deviation  bar is a vertical line that moves
            accross the HUD and indicates which way of the correct  line
            you  are.  If the bar is left of center then this means that
            you are to the right of the Localizer beam,  so  you  should
            correct  your approach to the left. When the bar is right of
            center you will need to move to the right too. You are  cor-
            rectly  aligned when the bar is at the center. You can judge
            the bar's position by noting the number of ticks  along  the
            horizontal  bar.  The larger middle one is where you want to
            be. The bar is at full deflection when  your  error  is  2.5
            degrees.

            The Glide Path deviation bar is a horizontal line that indi-
            cates where the correct descent line  is.  If  the  line  is
            above  center  then  the  you  should be flying higher (your
            descent is too rapid or you are descending toward a point on
            the  ground  too  short of the runway); you should gain some
            height or reduce your descent angle. In the same  way,  when
            the line is below HUD center you are above the correct path.
            The bar is at  full  deflection  when  your  error  is  0.75
            degrees.

            Note  that  the ILS system does not know where you are head-
            ing, it just tells you how close  you  are  to  the  correct
            approach path. The system does not even know if you are com-
            ing or going! So make sure that you approach the runway from


            _V_e_r_s_i_o_n _1_._1_2                _F_L_Y_8            _F_l_i_g_h_t _S_i_m_u_l_a_t_o_r





                                       _P_a_g_e _4_9



            the correct end or the ILS Localizer deviation bar will show
            reverse reading and the Glide Path will direct you  to  land
            at the far end of the runway.

            Real  ILS systems have very narrow beams and will only oper-
            ate when you are reasonably aligned. These systems will tell
            you  when  you  are  out of range. The one in Fly8 is active
            within a radius of about 25 kilometers around the runway.

            When the ILS is operating a marker along the  heading  scale
            will  direct  you  to  the  airport;  use it for the general
            approach but then identify the correct runway carefully.

            To select the desired runway use the  ILS  menu  and  choose
            from  the list.  There are now two airports (A is home and B
            is for the drones) and each has two runways: 18 (approach at
            heading 180) and 27 (approach at 270).  You can turn the ILS
            off and it will still remember the last active runway  which
            will  be  offered  when you use the command again. These ILS
            aids are defined in fly.nav and you can  change  these.  The
            'H'  command  option  is used to designate your home runway,
            otherwise it is the first one defined (the  drones  use  the
            last one in the list).

            The  radar  in  this program does NOT try to simulate a real
            radar. The real thing has many types and modes of operation.
            This one just cheats to get its data.

            When  enabled  ('r')  the radar measures distance, direction
            and speed of possible targets.

            In the basic mode, the radar constantly selects the  closest
            target.  This may cause it to 'jump' between targets as they
            change distance. You can put  the  radar  in  'locked'  mode
            ('l')  which  will  make it stick to the selected target. In
            this mode, when a target is destroyed,  the  nearest  target
            will  be  selected  and  stay locked. Use 'l' to release the
            lock (or you can turn the radar off/on with 'rr').

            There are 3 other acquisition modes controlled  by  the  'f'
            command.

                 0    pick closest target (old way, as described above).

                 1    3.3deg circle: boresight. Only targets inside  the
                      small circle are detected.

                 2    20deg  circle:  HUD.  Any  target inside the large
                      circle (which covers most  of  the  HUD  area)  is


            _V_e_r_s_i_o_n _1_._1_2                _F_L_Y_8            _F_l_i_g_h_t _S_i_m_u_l_a_t_o_r





                                       _P_a_g_e _5_0



                      detected.

                 3    5.3deg  wide  by  60deg  high:  vertical.  Targets
                      inside the narrow band (+-5.3 degrees wide but  60
                      degrees tall) are detected.

            In  modes 1-3, a target is highlighted when it is within the
            designated area. The limits of the modes 1-3  are  drawn  on
            the HUD.

            If  you  are  in  locked mode then the first detected target
            will immediately be locked, otherwise you will have  to  hit
            'l'  to  lock  the highlighted target. Only when a target is
            locked you get the aiming reticle (if it is close enough).

            It should be made clear that the 'locked' mode is  set/reset
            by  you with the 'l' command. Once engaged, there is no need
            to lock on targets because the first  one  to  qualify  will
            immediately be locked on. If you want then to select another
            target then use 'l' to release the target and then later 'l'
            to lock on the new one.

            Once  a  target  is locked, the selection markings disappear
            and the piper shows (or if it is still  far  then  only  the
            target designator box shows).

            A target is identified with a box around it (the target des-
            ignator).  When the target is out of  view  the  box  has  a
            large  '+' crossing it which changes to a large 'X' when the
            target is actually behind you.

            If you issue Shift-C then the plane will chase  the  current
            target  (there  must  be  one  or the plane will just patrol
            round the runway). Use the 'k' command  to  allow  automatic
            firing ('k' works even when not in Chase mode, and is useful
            if you want to practice the chase and let the auto-pilot  do
            the shooting).

            When the reticle goes off-screen it gets a '+' inside it.

            You  can  shoot  at  various objects. Use the 'emit' menu to
            create these objects.

            When you hit something it gets damaged  and  fragments  fall
            off.  When  enough  damage  is done the object is officially
            HIT. It blinks  red/white  and  starts  falling  toward  the
            ground.  Practice  targets  are destroyed immediately. These
            fragments are lethal and can hit any other object!  Normally
            you  can  fly  through any object EXCEPT a bullet - so don't
            stay behind a broken plane or you may be hit by the  falling
            fragments.

            As  others  said before, playing with oneself is fun but you
            don't make as many friends (they said you'll go blind  too).

            The program will let you play with others using a variety of
            communication media.  Once  networked,  objects  are  shared
            between  the  players. The number of players is only limited
            by the capability of the network medium.

            Below here, numeric parameter values can be given in C  for-
            mat,  i.e.  if it starts with 0x it is hex, starts with 0 is
            octal, else it is decimal.

            Note how you must give your own ip (ip=) and the  server  ip
            (sip=).  Your  own ip can be anything but your sysadmin must
            allocate it, while the server ip is the actual  ip  for  the
            host that is running the fly8udp server.

            By  default this driver uses port 0xf8f9 (change with port=)
            and expects the server to be on port 0xf8f8 (use  sport=  to
            change it).

            The   djgpp   version  accepts  a  parameter  'nbufs='  that

            specifies the number of receive  buffers  to  allocate.  The
            default  is  20.  Fly8  accepts packets very often and it is
            unlikely that you will need to increase this parameter under
            normal circumstances.

            The FIFO driver will allow communication using FIFOs as well
            as a tty serial line.

            This driver provides a head-to-head capability through FIFOs
            or  other similar  steam oriented facility. For one, it will
            allow connecting through a serial port (or other  '/dev/tty'
            type connections).

            Basically,  you  nominate  an input file (if=) and an output
            file (of=) and Fly8 will use these. For example, this is how
            you start a two player head-to-head on a pair of FIFOs:

            The two fifos can be created as

                 mkfifo ff81

            Note  that  the  two  programs run with different user names
            (N*) but share the same team (T*). This means that they can-
            not fight each other. Use a different team name for dueling.

            Also note that a different log file is used  by  each  (L*).
            This is needed only if both run from the same directory.

            To  play  accross  a  serial line, simply start this on both
            machines

            OK,  you  started  the  program  with  networking. It really
            enjoys it but then it is a computer. You want  to  enjoy  it
            too.  Here  is  how.  The Net menu has a set of commands for
            managing your connections with other players.

            Some of the requests in this menu will need you to  identify
            a  player.  A  list  of  players is displayed and you should
            select one by entering their name. If you Enter '*' then you
            will  select  all  of  them.  If you Enter '+' then you will
            select all of your team members. If your  response  is  null
            then  you  select  none. If there is only one player then it
            wil be selected automatically. Otherwise, you can enter  the
            start  of  the name and team so that the first partial match
            will be selected.

            A message 'no net' means that the program was started  with-
            out  the  net  option  (or  possibly all net connections are
            inaccessible).

            A message 'no player' may  be  displayed  which  means  that
            there  are  no  players in the needed status (eg. you try to
            'quit' but you are not currently playing with anyone).

                 ping
                      This is a broadcast ping to all players. All other
                      programs  will  respond with their identification.
                      Now you know who is active on the net. How do  you
                      tell  who's who? the parameter -Nxxx supplies your
                      handle (nickname, etc.) and you will be  known  by
                      it in this game.

                 play
                      Request  to  play with another player. If there is
                      only one then the program will go ahead and estab-
                      lish connection. Otherwise you will be prompted to
                      select a player from a list. To have  the  program
                      know  who  is  playing  you should have used the P
                      command first.

                 quit
                      Quit playing. If there are more players  then  you
                      will  get a list to choose from. An empty response
                      will assume you want to quit all players.

                 message
                      Send a message to a player.  Right  now,  an  echo
                      message  will also be sent and the turnaround trip
                      time (in milliseconds) will be shown. This time is
                      end-to-end including program delay.

            In  addition  to  the above commands which you will use from
            time to time, there are a number of  options  on  this  menu
            which  you  may  want  to set at program startup (or wish to
            continue to handle manually).

                 accept
                      If you are in 'manual reply' mode  then  you  will
                      get  messages  about players who want to play with
                      you. Use this option to accept them.

                 decline
                      If you are in 'manual reply' mode  then  you  will
                      get  messages  about players who want to play with
                      you. Use this option to decline their request.

                 auto accept
                      Set the game to always accepy playing requests.

                 auto delcine
                      Set the game to always decline playing requests.

                 manual reply
                      Set the program to ask you to accept/decline play-
                      ing requests.

                 auto connect
                      This  option  will  attempt  to connect to all net
                      players continuously. It will also accept all play
                      requests  automatically.  If  you  plan to use any
                      communication then it is a  good  idea  to  always
                      enable  this  option  - just add it to the startup
                      macro in fly.max.

            When you exit the program it  will  automatically  quit  all
            players and notify the net of your exit.

            If  long  delays are observed then a player may be automati-
            cally timed out. You  will  see  messages  about  this.  Use
            'play'  to  re-establish  contact.  Proper use of 'quit' and
            'play' will let you pop out of sight in danger  and  re-join
            in a more favourable position :-)

                 IMPORTANT NOTE: the comms at this point is one-on-
                 one. If you connect to three  other  players  then
                 they  all show in your world and you show in their
                 but they do not know of  each  other  unless  they
                 establish  connections  too.  If a group plays and
                 each one joins with a global 'play' then  everyone

            There  is  a  need  for proper 'game' management (co-ordina-
            tion), now completely lacking.

            This file  serves  as  an  extension  to  the  command  line
            options.   The  command-line  option  'I'  can  set  a  user
            selected file name, this option MUST be on the command line.

            Fly8 acquires parameters from three sources:

                 The ini file
                      One   parameter   per  line.  Leading  blanks  are
                      skipped, then first blank terminates  the  parame-
                      ter. '#' denotes a comment line.

                      The file is searched for in the current directory,
                      then in your home directory (using the HOME  vari-
                      able) then in each directory along your PATH.

                 The environment variable FLY8
                      Parameters are separated by a semicolon.

                 The command line options
                      The  usual rules apply, but the traditional '-' is
                      NOT required.
            These sources are processed in the  above  order  and  later
            parameters  override earlier ones. The parameters consist of
            one letter followed by a value. Some  options  are  grouped,
            and then two letters identify the parameter.

            Numeric values are expected as hex (0x*) octal (0*) or deci-
            mal (otherwise).

                 h
                      Help - prints a list of options. This  option  was
                      removed,  and it now tells you to read the doco...

                 FFilesPath
                      Path where all files are to be  found.  Should  be
                      used only on the command line.

                 IIniFile
                      Specifies the name of an init file.

                      The default is 'fly.ini'. The file is searched for
                      in the current directory, then  in  the  home  dir


            _V_e_r_s_i_o_n _1_._1_2                _F_L_Y_8            _F_l_i_g_h_t _S_i_m_u_l_a_t_o_r





                                       _P_a_g_e _5_8



                      (uses  HOME  env.  var.) then the PATH directories
                      are checked. Only the first file  found  is  used.
                      Should be used onlye on the command line.

                 LLogFileName
                      The  file  to  use as the Fly8 log. It is appended
                      to.

                 MMacroFile
                      Name of keyboard macros file. [default is 'fly']

                 XNavFile
                      Name of nav data file. [default is 'fly']

                 YLandFile
                      Name of landscape file. [default is 'fly']

                 dpPointerDriver
                      The pointing device can be one of: keypad,  mouse,
                      astick,  bstick.  But  each version (port) of fly8
                      has different ones.

                      Example of pointer parameters:

                      dpAstick:hat:sh=3:d=046

                      This means "we have an analog hat (FCS) and it  is
                      on  channel  3  (2nd  stick  X).  we  want  to not
                      debounce buttons 0 (trigger) 4 and 6 (hat up down)
                      - these will fire continuously.

                      The  Fly8  X  axis  controlls the roll while the Y
                      axis controls the pitch.  The rudder is on X2  and
                      the  throttle  on Y2. A Thrustmaster analog HAT is
                      also on Y2. These assignments can be changed using
                      the  following  format:  ":sh=3"  will  use analog
                      channel 3 (X2) as the  source  for  the  throttle.
                      You  can  swap the X and Y using ":sx=2:sy=1". You
                      can change the direction of  an  axis  using  this
                      format:  ":st=-4"  which means the throttle should
                      be interpreted  in  reverse.  This  has  the  same
                      effect  as appending a hyphen to the 'ttl' option.

                      Each pointing device  can  have  more  parameters.
                      When  a  list of buttons is expected you can use a
                      simple  list  or  include  ranges,   for   example
                      ":a=1-4" will make buttons 1, 2, 3 and 4 sensitive
                      to the Btn-Alt mode.  If the '-' is at  the  start
                      then a '0' is assumes before it while at the end a
                      'z' is assumed. This means that  ":a=-"  will  set
                      all of the buttons.

                                     y).

                                hat
                                     Use y2 as the FCS  hat.  The  posi-
                                     tions  are  called  buttons 4 (up),
                                     5(right), 6(down) & 7(left). Do not
                                     use  this option for the CHPro, see
                                     the special 'chpro' option later.

                                ttl
                                     Use y2  as  throttle.  if  you  use
                                     ":ttl-"  then  the throttle will be
                                     read such that full-range is  zero-
                                     throttle  and  zero-range  is full-
                                     throttle (which is how the  CH  and
                                     WCS do it).

                                rdr
                                     Use   y1  as  rudder.  if  you  use
                                     ":rdr-" then  the  rudder  will  be
                                     read  such  that  the  two ends are
                                     reversed.

                                     Read no buttons. This is used  when
                                     the  buttons  are delivered through
                                     the keyboard using a WCS or FLCS.

                                     called  0,1,2  & 3. Do not use this
                                     option for the CHPro, see the  spe-

                                     Used to indicate that you are using
                                     a CH Pro Flightstick which has four
                                     buttons and a hat and has a differ-

                                     etc.).  The  delay may be necessary
                                     if doing multiple reads since  some
                                     joystick ports are slow to reset.

                 dtTimerDriver
                      Allowes you to select, and pass parameters to, the
                      timer device. You will  probably  never  use  this
                      option.

                 PMainObject:options

                 DDroneObject:options
                      The  main  and  drone  object type. If absent then
                      drone type defaults to the main  type.  While  any
                      object name can be used (for most *.vxx present in
                      the  Fly8  directory)   currently   only   "plane"
                      responds  to  controls  and it supports a dynamics
                      type option: classic, basic or f16. The default is
                      "plane:basic".

                      An experimental Car type (no options) is being put
                      together a an example of how to add new types.

                 VVideoModesFile
                      The video modes file to use, e.g. 'Vgrvesa'  means
                      to   use   the   file  'grvesa.vmd'.  [default  is
                      'fly.vmd']

                 mVideoMode
                      The video mode. This is one of the  modes  defined
                      in the .vmd file you use.

                 iString
                      Initialization keystrokes. The string is a list of
                      macros to execute at startup. The default is Ctrl-
                      A.  The  string  'iCaezAb' will execute, in order:
                      Ctrl-a Ctrl-e Ctrl-z Alt-b. Only  Ctrl-  and  Alt-
                      type  macros  can be used here. Macros are defined
                      in the *.max file.

                 bn
                      Windows configuration. The 'n' is the same  letter
                      as used on the 'Windows' menu.

                 r
                      Activate  network  playing  (used  to  be 'support

                      This  is  used  to prefix a list of options (sepa-
                      rately described as  'oq'  etc.  later).  You  can
                      embed  '-', '+' and '^' to set, clear or toggle an
                      option respectively.  For  example  "o-qv+l"  will
                      turn off sound and verbose, and turn on landscape.

                 oc

                      driver  between  frames  rather than erase the old
                      frame by retracing it  in  background  color.  The
                      retrace way is often much quicker with Fly8 (which
                      is  mostly  wireframe)  but  some  modern  graphic
                      devices can erase the screen fater than that.

                      Minimum  time  (milliseconds) between frames. This
                      allows you to limit the frame rate, and is  useful
                      if  you  do not have double buffering.  Default is
                      10ms and it is also the lowest allowed.

                 niDynamicsStep
                      Max time for single step plane dynamics.  Used  to

                 nuUpdateRate
                      Minimum time (milliseconds) between network status
                      update.  By  default Fly8 sends update information
                      for each object at a regular 60m interval. If  you
                      use  a  slow  network (modem) with many users then
                      you may want to reduce the update rate  (e.g.  set
                      it to 125ms to 8 updates/sec).

                 cColor
                      Sets  any  one  of the color definition. The color
                      name is the same as used on the  color  menu.  The
                      value is as RGB, each componnent is 8 bits.  Exam-
                      ple: ch0x60c060 set hud-low ('h') color  to  light
                      green (R=60, G=c0 B=60, all in hex).

            This file logs the activity of the program, problem messages
            and final stats. The command-line option -L can set  a  user
            selected file name.

            This  file is read at program startup and written at program
            shutdown.  It is  the  list  of  keyboard  macros.  Use  the
            'mac2max'  program to list the contents of this file. At the
            moment there is no macro editor so you should use the  rede-
            fine-macro  for updating. The command-line option -M can set
            a user selected file name. It  is  easier  to  maintain  the
            fly.max  (see  later)  manually,  the  fly.mac  file  may be
            removed in the future.

            1144..44  ffllyy..mmaaxx

            This file is read on program startup  and  defined  keyboard
            macros.  If it does not exist then fly.mac is read, if there
            is none then no macros are defined (at this  point).  During
            shutdown  all  keyboard  macros are written to fly.mac (will
            OVERWRITE the original!).

            fly.max is a text file while fly.mac is a binary format.

            It used to be that you could only define macros at run  time
            using  the  F7 facility. However, now you will probably edit
            fly.max instead. However, if you do add new macros  interac-
            tively then you can use:
                 mac2max fly.mac >new.max

            Lists  the  navigation  waypoints  which  have  ILS beacons.
            Should really be merged with the landscape file.  Maybe  one
            day. It is created from the fly.nac file using an awk script
            (in the 'parms' directory).

            This is a very basic  file  that  nominates  the  navigation
            points.  Fly8  is  not  strong in this area, however you can
            activate the ILS system which will use one of these beacons.

            The file structure is as follows:

            First  you nominate the number of points you are defining (I

            Defines  the  contents  of the landscape. It is created from
            the fly.lnc file  using  the  C  pre-processor  and  an  awk
            script.

            It is mechanically built from fly.lnc. It describes the con-
            tents of the landscape.

            This file is a list of objects and their placement. You  can
            place  the standard objects (defined in separate .vxx files)
            as well as define new objects. The new objects will  not  be
            animated are are used for the fixed landscape.

            And object placement has the following format:

                O_RUNWAY, CC_DEFAULT,    /* runway A */
                  V(0), V(0), V(0),   /* position x, y, z */

            The  first  line  is the object name (each object is defined
            once and is assigned a number, this one is '1') and the data
            resolution:  V_METERS  means  that the data is to be kept in
            meters (no fractions) while V_FINE means that internal  data
            representation is in 1/16 of a meter.

            Next  you  nominate  the number of vertices (must me right!)
            and following are the vertices. Each is an (x,  y,  z)  trio
            and an indication as to the visibility of that vertex.

            To  place  a local object use a name of the format O_LOCAL+1
            (for the object in the above example).

            1144..77  **..vvxxxx

            This file can mechanically built from *.vx. It  defines  the
            shape of an object.

            The  .vxx  file  is a simple list of numbers. The first line
            gives the number of vertices in the object and nominates the
            resolution of the following data: 2 means 1=1meter while '1'
            means 1=1/16meter.

            The data is a list of (x, y, z) points followed by  1  (line
            not visible) or 2 (line visible).

            No  punctuation  marks are used on this file and data cannot
            be moved from the nominated lines (2 numbers  of  the  first
            line and 4 on the rest).

            This  file  can  be built from a more flexible file (usually
            stored as a .vx) which is then processd by the C  preproces-
            sor an an expression evaluator which builds the .vxx file.

            Some  of  the  .vx  files look line C initializers - this is
            because objects used to be internal definitions. There is no
            point in making this any nicer since the whole object repre-
            sentation will at some stage be  completely  upgraded  to  a
            full polygon based structure.

            1144..88  **..pprrmm

            These  files define the various aircraft parameters. Differ-
            ent parameters are used by different flight models,  but  if
            you modify a parameter file it is best to set ALL parameters
            so that all model will work.

            The file that you create is the *.prc, which  is  then  pro-
            cessed  into  a *.prm file (which is then read by fly8). The
            fly8 options 'P' and 'D' select which parameter file will be
            read (so 'fly8 Pf16' will read the 'f16.prm' file).

            The  *.prc  file  has short comments against each line which
            should give some idea about each value. Note that  the  data
            is explicily integer.  This means that fractions are kept as
            fixed point. Also, other data (line angles and lengths) have
            a  fraction  part; however, you should not worry about this,
            just make sure that you specify the data using  the  correct
            format.  If  you see a drag coefficient specified as F(0.02)
            then keep using the F() format - this will convert the frac-
            tion  to  the  fly8  representation. Following are the types
            recognized (look at 'parms.h' for  the  definitions  if  you
            wish):

                 F(x)
                      Stores  x  as  a fraction. x should be kept in the
                      range -1.0 to 1.0.

                 F10(x)
                      Stores x as a scaled fraction. x should be kept in
                      the range -10.0 to 10.0.

                 V(x)
                      Length  representation.  Will  be stores as meters
                      with four binary fraction bits (just over 6cm).

                 VV(x)
                      Special format  for  high  resolution  lengths.  x
                      should be kept to a reasonably small value (-128.0
                      to 128.0) but the resolution is to 8  bits  (about
                      4mm). This is used in giving delicate landing gear
                      dimentions.

                 G
                      Constant of gravity (9.810). Useful  for  defining
                      forces.

                 D(x)
                      Stores x degrees in fly8 format.

                 DV(x)
                      Stores x degrees/sec in fly8 format.

                 I10(x)
                      Stores a large integer with -1 decimal point (that
                      means that a weight of 12876 is stores as '1287').
            In all of the above 'x' can be any number (integer or float-
            ing point) or any expression of these. The expression evalu-
            ator  understand most of the standard C operators. Also, you
            can use the C preprocessor syntax in this file since  it  is
            being run through it anyway.

            Note  that fly8 expects the parameters in the correct format
            so never change the format notation in the *.prc file,  just
            change the values.

            The  most  important  parameter is the first item in the '10
            options' list (towards the end), it selects the flight model
            program.

            can set a user selected file name. The readme should itemize
            the available mode files for the different environments.

            The  file is a list of mode lines. Each line has the follow-
            ing format:

            This directory is where one build the *.lnd, *.prm and *.nav
            files from the free form input. The 'data' directory can  be
            located  anywhere  but I find is easy to keep is as a subdi-
            rectory of the Fly8 game directory.

            The files here are:

                 *.lnd
                      built from *.lnc, this is  the  landscape  descip-
                      tion.

                 *.prm
                      built  from  *.prc,  this  is the plane parameters
                      file.

                 *.nav
                      built from *.nav, this file gives some  navigation
                      data.

            The  steps  to  follow  in  building the files are described
            below. The 'build' batch file is available for msdos  but  a

            similar one should be done for unix etc. It simple automates
            a rather simple process.

                 1
                      Edit the source file (lnc/prc/nac).  Use  whatever
                      editor you prefer, these are plain text files.

                 2
                      Do 'build File Type' where File is the name of the
                      file you edited (without extension!) and  type  is
                      lnd/prm/nav  as appropriate.  This script will run
                      your file through the  C  pre-processor  and  then
                      through an awk script (expr.awk).

                 3
                      Copy  the  new  file  (lnd/prm/nav)  to  your game
                      directory. Or you can give the  directory  on  the
                      build 'build File Type CopyToDirectory'.

                 4
                      Change  to  the  game  directory and play. The new
                      file will now be used.

            When you eject ('E') you will find yourself on a  parachute.
            When  you land, you will move to a new plane. You can accel-
            erate the descent with 'D' but if  the  plane  did  not  yet
            crash  then  you  will (have to) wait on the ground until it
            crashes and a new one is provided.

            The IBMPC uses a timer chip with three counters. Fly8  reads


            _V_e_r_s_i_o_n _1_._1_2                _F_L_Y_8            _F_l_i_g_h_t _S_i_m_u_l_a_t_o_r





                                       _P_a_g_e _7_5



            counter  0 to get high resolution interval timing and writes
            counter 2 to generate speaker sound. Counter 0 is often  set
            to  the wrong mode by various programs (some examples: Land-
            mark 1.14 sets the mode to 3 while version 2.00 sets  it  to
            2)  .  The standard is mode 3, but it is sometimes set to 2.
            Fly8 needs to have the timer in the mode 2 or 3 or it  reads
            bad timing information.

            The  program  'gettimer' will report the current mode. If it
            is 36/34 or  b6/b4  then  the  mode  is  correct.  Fly8  was
            upgraded  to support the most common two modes and can actu-
            ally operate with non-standard timer settings (I should doc-
            ument these special parameters somewhere).

            The program settimer will set the timer to mode 3.

               +o On  a  486DX50 the serial driver fails at 115200 but is
                 ok at 57600.  Output buffering at high speed looses the
                 comms.  It  is  now  fixed  with  a kludge in the comms
                 driver.

               +o On fast machines attempting to read the joystick  twice
                 in  a  row produces unexpected results. A special delay
                 option was introduced to get around this problem.

               +o The stroke character generator will not  handle  stroke
                 sizes  above  128  pixels.  May be a problem if you try
                 running at very high resolutions (say 1600x1200).

               +o On slow machines the program may  fail  with  a  divide
                 overflow. It also may happen (rarely) on fast machines.
                 This will be fixed gradually as sensitive areas of  the
                 program get cleaned.
