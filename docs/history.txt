Changes in release 1.12
=======================

[25 June 99]
- On linux use do_gettimeofday.

[21 February 98]
- replace some static tables with mallocs since Win3.1 finds the
  result too large...
- Add NT mingw32 and lcc-win32.
- Streamline welcome message.
- retest the builds on NT, msdos, win3.1 and Linux.

[ 7 September 97]
- Add more key names. mac2max now shows function names, which may at
  times be overkill - use '-r' option to have raw names.
- rewrite macro expansion.

[ 4 September 97]
- Fix problem where F8 macros could not be used.

[31 August 97]
- NT/95: read all extra buttons.
- tighten CHPRO hat interpretation.
- build on SGI Irix.

[30 August 97]
- change format of axes override.

[29 August 97]
- update doco to point to ftp://samba.anu.edu.au/pub/eyal/fly8 as primary
  site.
- Call it 1.12 officially (no more beta).
- Fix w32stick for NT.

[1 June 97]
- Merged Chris' stuff in.
- found out that inlined asm in vc5.0 now sometimes pushes ebp too.
  Fixed mswin/bgrasm.c, now WinG and DirectDraw work.

[1 June 97] - Chris
- Fixed a stupid little bug in the Win32 Joystick Driver, when emulating
  a chpro, it was setting the buttons according to the hat, then setting
  the buttons to their states.  The correct order for this is, of course,
  the other way 'round, as button state would overwrite the hat position
  data  (its also a CHPro design flaw - can't use the buttons whilst
  using the hat).
- Fixed an "oversight" where buttons 1 & 2 could be pressed simultaniously
  when the chpro emulation was enabled.  Doing so on a real chpro is not
  possible since it would cause a "Hat Left" signal instead.

[31 May 97] - Chris
- Finished DirectDraw Support (NT4/W95).  Doesn't run too fast on my 5x86,
  but it works, and I didn't need to use any CPP. :-) on my 5x86/160 in
  800x600x256, speeds are 20-30fps with line sky, 30-60fps with no sky, and
  10fps for solid sky.  Discovered that this run was with a pentium optimised
  copy :-)  5x86's are not pentiums :-(
- Win32 joystick support fixed -- Dunno if it works with a hat yet, I
  don't have a joystick with a w95 supported hat to test it with.
  The way the new joystick driver works it that it breaks down the
  option string (again) to get user capabilities - and from that, it
  emulates the devices specified if they can be found on the joystick
  Interface.  If it works, everything is going well.

[20 May 97]
- Built with ms vc5.0, no drama. [but see 1 Jun 97 entry]
- use my new email address everywhere (eyal@eyal.emu.id.au).

[10 May 97]
- Figured out why we segfault every once in a blue moon. The check for
  a live owner object is too weak. Some object have apointer to an owner
  object. However, objects disapper (naturally) and the children may
  find the pointer to not be valid. So the owner object id is also
  stored with the pointer and this is compared against the owner to
  see that it really is the one. Well, one in a while a completely
  unrelated piece of memory reuses the dead owner memory and happens
  to have the correct value in the 'id' offset. Bad luck, we assume
  the owner is there and we go to never never land.
  A stronger test is now done - we verify a few more fields to be
  valid too. A new stats item 'Fix1' counts how many times the new code
  saved our butt.

[19 Apr 97]
- Chris is writing a Win32 joystick driver. Not yet working.

[ 9 Apr 97]
- Fix more bugs in rudder code in stick.c. Really embarrasing...

[ 6 Apr 97]
- Fix bug in rudder code in stick.c.

[ 9 Mar 97]
- minor makefile/install changes.

[10 Feb 97]
- minor change in shutdown stats report

[ 9 Feb 97]
- fix bug in ptrmgr.c which caused pointer-device problems.
- clean up the pointer code.
- remove some 'interval' parameters, these are leftover from an old
  abandoned change.
- impose stricter simulation time limits - on fast machines (very short
  time intervals, under 10ms) the integer maths suffers significant
  truncation errors.

[19 Jan 97]
- upgrade djgpp/grvbe.c to support both banked and linear modes. Add
  new 'banked' option to ignore the linear buffer. Some cleanup too.

[18 Jan 97]
- Implement new parameters for VBE func9 (djgpp/grvbe.c). Ad new
  option 'xyf7' to enable obsolete prot-mode func7(x,y) call.
- add sys_poll() calls to [bv]gr.c so as not to lose clock ticks on
  slow msdos machines.

[ 7 Jan 97]
- Allow 10+26+26 pointer buttons. Reorg do_btn().
- add Thrustmaster F22/TQS definition files.

[25 Dec 96]
- rename utils: get_p[i]arg -> get_s[i]arg, get_[i]arg -> get_p[i]arg.

[23 Dec 96]
- allow Fly8 server UDP port argument as:
	fly8udp [port]
	udpmgr [host][:port]
  'port' is decimal, default is IPPORT_FLY8 = 0xf8f8.
  'host' default is 'localhost'.
- fix udpmgr to not wait for input if HAVE_SELECT and !interactive.
- replace FLY8_EWOULDBLOCK with FLY8_SOCKWOULDBLOCK.

[15 Dec 96]
- Initial successfull build using Cygwin32-1.7.1 on NT. Only GDI (slow)
  graphics, udp works OK.
  Still needs:
	- WinG [.lib] (the official wing.h is OK)
	- Wave playing [.h] (no mmsystem.h)
	- joystick driver
  I had to do this:
	- modify in Windows32.h/sockets.h 'fd_set" to 'eyal_fd_set'.
	- add my own small mmsystem.h (see mmsystem.cyg).

[16 Oct 96]
- mswin/WinG: Add test for proper display mode.

[13 Oct 96]
- mswin/nt: Start DirectDraw port (Chris). Replace the icon with a working
  one too.

[10 Oct 96]
- mswin/nt: use vgaset() for VGASET. This brings the grvWinG driver closer
  to the speed of grWinG.

[ 8 Oct 96]
- note: mswin/grwing.c should check for 8bit mode! It now ungracefully
  crashes if it's not.

[ 7 Oct 96]
- Try the Cygnus gcc for win32. Too many problems (missing functions and
  types). Still, it's a nice setup, I should try to fix it.
- Replace WATTCP with SYS_WATTCP. Replace SYS_MSWIN with SYS_WINSOCK where
  appropriate.
- rename MSWIN platform names and update config.bat.
- use WSAEWOULDBLOCK for winsock.

[ 4 Oct 96]
- Even cleaner OS/2 builds, for both emx and va.

[ 3 Oct 96]
- Some cleanup.
- new os2/emx makefiles from Mike.
- add (open) VMS directory, to be later merged into UNIX.

[ 1 Oct 96]
- tested, the NT version works fine on 95.

[29 Sep 96]
- tested: Linux.
- add NT asm support for graphics (mswin/bgrasm.c). Almost doubles the drawing
  speed.
- NT compile with -G5 (pentium).
- win 3.1: remove '-Zp' flag.
- notes that the win3.11 version, when run undel NT, fails if networking
  is attempted.
- fix bug in mswin/grmswin.c - now all graphics drivers work under NT.

[28 Sep 96]
- add win NT support. It still uses the WinG interface, but it is a native
  32bit application.
- note: for NT, only the WinG drivers work!
- expect wing.h/lib in the compiler directory and not in a WinG directory.
- tested: win 3.11 vc1; win NT vc4; msdos vc1; msdos djgpp v2;

[27 Sep 96]
- add termgp() to unix/gpport.c when no USE_GP.
- disable bgrasm.x if no USE_BGRASM.
- add some comments to Linux makefiles for non-intel platforms.

[ 2 Sep 96]
- updated makefile/config for os2/emx [miket].
- the binary package is not clean yet.

[29 Aug 96]
- updated makefile for os2/emx [miket].

[26 Aug 96]
- fixed mswin/os2 mouse position handling [miket].
- update b11 with above fix.

[19 Aug 96]
- fixed the UNIX icon.
- update fly81121.zip with above fix.

[16 Aug 96]
- noted that the unix icon feature is incorrect (will be fixed soon).
- Fly8 1.12b11 released.

[16 Aug 96]
- Fix SixDOF() bug.
- General cleanup.

[14 Aug 96]
- add icon to unix (thanks Chris).
- add object update rate control.

[27 Jul 96]
- enough is enough - make 1.12 official. We'll worry about winNT/95 native
  ports later.

[26 Jul 96]
- fix unix makefiles.

[10 May 96]
- djgpp/v2 needs the "b" in fopen() for binary mode (caused fm sound to not
  work...).

[21 April 96]
- add proper delay to plfm/pladlib. Noted that the whole effect business
  needs a healthy look at.

[14 April 96]
- minor makefiles changes in msdos.
- tested: msdos: b2, b3, b4, b4.5

[13 April 96]
- debug the c8 build.
- upgrade all makefiles to include fm sound.
- upgrade all makefiles to include udp program (even when dummied).
- tested: msdos: c8, qc, dj1, dj2
- tested: linux
- tested: mswin: c8

[11 April 96]
- renamed PID to F8PID (OS/2 conflicts).
- was oversealous: sometimes added too many args for fcntl()
- some OS/2 updates from Mike.

[10 April 96]
- added FM sound support from Chris (djgpp and msdos).
- added OS/2 port from Mike.
- added third parameter to fcntl() in common/fly8udp.c & common/udpmgr.c
- do proper messaging from fly8udp to udpmgr.

[9 April 96] - Chris
- discovered that Win95 really hates DJv2 version of Fly8, crashes without
  recovery every time.  :-)  well,.....
- added basic SoundBlaster FM support (after having to work it out,
  and fix my use of case.. DOH!) 
- debugged most of my basic FM support - discovered that FM volume is
  0 -> 127, not 0 -> 255!  This led to having not much sound at all....
- added banktool to the djgpp release for manipulating the fm banks.
  still need an external editor, I recommend bunked.
- added more advanced fm support.  FM now has crude patch implemtation,
  different patches for different sounds!  Probably will be broken if
  any more sounds are added to the system, but can easily be fixed.

[8 April 96] - Chris
- Discovered that GAWK doesn't like eyal's awk scripts....  I'll let eyal
  fix that.

[31 March 96]
- update doco to point to ftp://ftp.canberra.edu.au/pub/ise/eyal as primary
  site.

[22 March 96]
- fix mswin/wing Polygon when 'inverted'.

[ 2 March 96]
- fix UNIX/fifo.c bad packet_del().
- fix UNIX/fifo.c memory allocation bug (when packing).
- reorganize memory.c debugging options.
- adjust UNIX/flyudp and ./flyfifo scripts.

[25 February 96]
- fixed NULL ref in unix/gri.c
- add ELF names to bgrasm.x.
- move bgrasm.o to AOBJS.
- use HAVE_SVGALIB for svgalib driver rather than SYS_LINUX.
- properly set and install mgr/server scripts.
- replace color ST_INFO with ST_IFG.
- change gr_color() to handle 16bit colors properly.
- add init/term to plspeak.c.
- add init/term messages to nosound.c.
- use #if rather than #ifdef for all NEED_* and HAVE_* manifests.
- tested X11 16bpp OK now.
- Noted: XFillPolygon() leaved unfilled edges (or bottom of polygons and
  probably on right too).
- uploaded beta9.

[20 February 96]
- build with official djgpp v2.00. OK.

[ 6 February 96]
- update doco to point to ftp://ise.canberra.edu.au as primary site.

[ 3 February 96]
- further fixed common/udpmgr.c+fly8udp.c

[31 January 96]
- use select() for udpmgr wait on input. Added HAVE_SELECT to config.h.
- add detection of VBE supplemental functions to djgpp/grvbe.c. Not working
yet

[27 January 96]
- added the midi sound driver to mswin, msdos and djgpp.

[23 January 96]
- fixed Linux/svgalib driver (was drawing in black...).
- upgraded *.b3 files.

[22 January 96]
- improve horiz line drawing for vga.
- simplify sky.c.
- tested: msdos/msc:qc,7,8/bcc:2,3,4,4.5,mswin/c8
- cleaned /gr/line*.c and the makefiles.

[21 January 96]
- clean up vgr.c.
- add Polygon() and Clear() to msdos gr library.
- tested: msdos/c8, mswin/c8, djgpp/v2+v1, Linux/X11
- uploaded beta8.

[20 January 96]
- fix (last?) Polygon drawing bug.

[19 January 96]
- add midi sound to Linux version.
- add Polygon() to gr drivers. Now used to draw the sky/earth background, but
  ready for use to do polygon based graphics in general.
- tested: Linux, mswin/c8, djgpp/v2.

[14 January 96]
- move CC copy into oplane.c:plane_xfer(), now objects.c has no plane stuff.
- tested msdos/qc OK.
- add new syntax for Plane/Drone type to support arbitrary object type. Now
  one should say "Pplane:f16" where it was "Pf16".
- for all get_*() in utils.c, allow the leading ':' to be missing.
- fixed a (probably very old) bug in obox.c where the trigs were not filled
  in and they would show up as single lines...
- upload beta7.

[13 January 96]
- Chris wanted to see how one adds a new vehicle type so we added a 'car'.
  This broke a few modules that thought all vehicles are planes (stupid
  computers!)... there probably are still a few snags.
- fixed a few (expected) problems with ANGLE type
- general test with djgpp/v2 works fine. Need a few more tests before I
  upload it though.
- tested Linux/X11 OK.
- add '-c' and '-e' options to 'udpmgr' to do a quick command:
	# udpmgr -e stats
	# udpmgr -e shutdown
  '-c' sends the command and stays interactive, '-e' executes and exits.
- finish mswin/grmswin.c:Clear().
- add linear accels to object structure, and start using it:
  obasic.c, oxplane, oyplane [sixdof]
- tested msdos/c8 OK.
- tested mswin/c8 OK.

[12 January 96]
- move HUD_PANEL to HDD_PANEL.
- reorganize the whole picture drawing. Stereo is not working until this is
  finished.
- remove 'clear' option from gr drivers. Use the Fly8 'oc' startup option
  to enable the usage of the driver's Clear() function for screen clearing.
- ensure all debug options are named DEBUG_*.
- fix bug in bgr.c where we failed to use private WriteMode values.
- access machine is back! try and upload something that works...

[ 9 January 96]
- noted that the whole business of solid background does not work properly
  with the current logic in loop.c:show_picture(). We should modify the
  render_bg() and _fg() to have a 'render' mode and a 'show' mode to cater
  for the two things. As it is, the background may be painted at the wrong
  time (or into the wrong buffer) and be later cleared.
- fixed!

[ 8 January 96]
- fix mswin/wing Clear() for inverted writing.
- fix bug in oviewer.c: GAZE view was not setting the sine/cosine, so the
  sky was showing wrong in this view.
- ready to upload beta7, but access machine is down :-(

[ 7 January 96]
- fix Clear() everywhere to NOT translate color index.
- initialize st.colors[] to -1 (for unallocated).
- change most 'short's to 'ints' for platforms that do better that way.
- fix bgr.c/bClear() to use 'vgaset' instead of 'memset'.
- The short<->int change exposed a sign extension problem in the comms; fixed.
- add fast .asm 'memset' to msdos & mswin to double the speed of background
  drawing.
- disallow RedBlue stereo with SolidSky.
- tested: djgpp/v1+2, msdos/c7+c8+qc/bcc2+4+4.5, mswin/c8, linux/X11+svga
- ready to upload beta7, but access machine is down :-(

[ 6 January 96]
- remove obsolete 'font name' option.
- reorder critical init/term order.
- add system driver option string. Note: system and time driver strings
  are not yet used.
- add size+color parameters to gr driver Clear().
- fix last (?) problems that caused sky lines to fail.
- allow null Sys amd Tm Init()/Term().
- count solid-sky into video rather than 2D.
- fiddle with the clipping logic in show.c.
- djgpp: low.c now sets number of pages.
- tested: djgpp/v2, mswin/c8, msdos/c8, Linux/X11
- ready to upload beta7, but access machine is down :-(

[ 5 January 96]
- tested with bcc 4.5 - OK
- tested mswin 3.1 - OK
- tested under Win NT - OK, as fast as Win31 (using WinG).
  tried compiling native NT but got zilion errors from system headers.
- tested under OS/2 - OK, as fast as Win31 (using WinG).
- used some 32bit instruction in msdos graphics, bulk move/clear now runs
  twice as fast.
- fix two problems that cause sky lines to fail - it was not critical before
  but is very bad with solid background.
- ready to upload beta7, but access machine is down :-(

[ 4 January 96]
- add option for number of sky lines.
- add solid sky option (under screen menu)
- add "clear" option to djgpp video drivers; not really needed anymore.
- fixed scenery() to know about DHT_STORES.
- rename more colors.
- rename menu color names to a straight alpha list.

[ 3 January 96]
- minor reorg of DEVICE/SCREEN structures.
- show_fixed() was not locking set_sim() which gave interesting visual
  effects.
- get it working if Gr->Clear is enabled - was broken. Add "clear" option
  to grvbe/grasm.

[ 1 January 96]
- even more cleaning. Ensure all headers have proper include wrappers.
- merge djgpp video drivers, now grasm and grvbe can both be used in both
  systems, but they use different techniques in each.
- add control over the packet recv rate for the polled djgpp drivers.
- uploaded beta5.

[31 December 95]
- further refine djgpp/grvbe VBE video driver.

[30 December 95]
- add rudder option to joystick (:rdr[-]). Could not test it though...
- remove usage of libgr from v2, use the msdos mouse driver instead.
- djgpp/grasm.c also independent of libgr now (it is used in grdj.c only).

[29 December 95]
- finally got the gfx to work fast with djgpp v2.
- call get_cue() from oplane.c rather than during HUD drawing.
- add grasm (linear frame buffer) to djgpp v2,
	BUT IT DOES NOT WORK YET!!!
- uploaded beta4.

[27 December 95]
- oops, fixed bug in udp.c where unix was loosing *lots* of packets.
- noted that udpmgr eats tons of CPU in a busy wait, must insert some
  control over it or positively block on user (stdin) input.
- minor changes to info.c displays.
- new structure for mswin\config.bat
- rename mswin executable 'fly8.exe' as the rest.
- log "active" messages.

[26 December 95]
- now have a working djgpp v2 video driver, but bankswitching is too slow.
  need to investiagte the protected-mode VBE 2.0 features.

[25 December 95]
- further clean the winsock stuff, looks solid now.
- clean warnings in unix/js/js.c and jscal.c
- fix unix/flyudp for latest syntax
- new mswin/config.bat procedure, with WinG and winsock integrated.
- show time on 'stats' screen.
- change mmsound.c to square wave.

[24 December 95]
- mswin winsock driver now works. Still GPFs at times. Probably a true
  NULL reference in ochute.c, will check [yes, that was it].
- mswin version sometimes won't start: mswin/mswin.c fixed.
- add djgpp/v2 setup and change 'config dj' to 'config v1'. v2 still does
  NOT work.

[23 December 95]
- winsock driver works, sort of.
- fix NULL references in init.c

[22 December 95]
- test djgpp v2: not working, I need to find out where video memory is
  mapped to (used to be 0xd0000000).
- replace system name with SYS_*
- fix memory leak in udp.c
- start work on mswin winsock driver.

[14 December 95]
- Now working:
  - msdos: b2, b3, b4, b45, qc, c7, c8, djgpp v1
  - Linux
- show ip:port addresses in dot format whenever applicable.

[13 December 95]
- msdos: suspect that 'ds' is not available when entering pkint(), so I
  restored the old pkint()/pkset() method. We'll see. [seems to help]
- remove yet a few more warnings.
- Another micro&soft bug... this time with c8.00c (vc++ 1.5). Depending on
  the order of 'make'ing the support libraries, the objects are different.
  If I 'make serial net gr' then 'gr/low.o' is wrong, while if I 'make gr
  serial net' then it is fine.
- c7.00 still locks up, need to play with the optimization switches.
- expect IP numbers in pcudp.c as n.n.n.n rather than a hex number.

[10 December 95]
- port pcudp.c (low level packet-driver based UDP net driver) to djgpp.
  Still need to split into packet-support and Fly8 proper; another day...
- fix memory leak in djgpp\grasm.c
- ensure all drivers title their Log messages.
- move *.adv *.awk *.b50 *.bat files to misc/.
- move msdos/grvesa*.vmd and djgpp/grvesa*.vmd to misc/.

[ 7 December 95]
- c7/c8 still dies. narrowed it down to msdos/pcudp.c.
- still testing... some adjustment to net/pkint.asm may solve the crashes.
- fix memory leak in netmgr.c
- fix memory leak in message.c

[ 4 December 95]
- move config.h to main source directory.
- use AFASTCALL for fastcall compatability with msc.
- msdos/packet.c: do not report foreign net traffic as errors.
- bcc now works, as does qc but c7/c8 dies!

[ 3 December 95]
- add trace option ('ot') for debugging.
- fix problem where in X11 screen was cleared to white instead of black.
- bcc 3.0 still locks up: at palette setup.
- clean up the /GR library
- decide to go to v1.12 rather than release a patch.

[ 2 December 95]
- built bcc 3.0 (had to be done outside of windows).
  later: the binary locks up solid!

[30 November 95]
- add FAR to Bo* declarations in extern.h
- fix QC makefile (misspell OOUT=)
- link of fly8 fails with 'too many segments'. Use '/SE:500'.
- change the packet-driver xface to use a single array of ints. Hope this
  is the last portability problem I see in this section.
- tested OK with: msdos - bcc (2 4 4.5), msc (qc 7 8) and djgpp
- tested OK with: Linux (kernel 1.3.45, XFree 3.1.2A)

- land.c failed compile for mswin too, use -G2.
- new Frand function.

[ 6 January 95]
- avoid the Gr->Term in case the ->Init failed (used to seg fault).

[ 5 January 95]
- allow log flush rate of -1 for 'immediate'.
- disabled unix/gri.c if pixel depth is not 8 bits.
- fix null reference in buffers.c: buffer_close().
- fix using 'ch' instead of 'hdd' in window.c:menu_windows().

[ 4 January 95]
- show video mode on welcome option.
- hud.parts.ground now exits when done.
- fix null reference in editstr.c.
- log.c: better logic for NOTHINGTOLOG. Also, at startup we set log flush
  time to zero untill user options are read. Then the default is 1000.

[ 3 January 95]
- make shape_read a bit more general. Also have it convery object file names
  to lower case.
- upload to 'fir' for testing.

[ 2 January 95]
- fix the stereo.red-blue which was broken by the new color mgmt.
- fix the stereo hud position when zoomed in.
- replace 'l' option (landscape) with 'ol' (the generic options parameter).

[ 1 January 95] should I call this version "Fly8 95" :-)

- fix bug in draw_border using wrong colors.
- clear the screen after a new palette setting.
- add screen.Clear menu option.
- default mirror to wide angle.

[31 December 94]
- complete the color management system.
- upgrade msdos/packet.c to the new header format. Now ComVer 7 is definitly
  NOT compatible with older versions.

[30 December 94]
- rename menu_colors -> menu_palette, used (as before) to program the colors
  palette. Add new menu_colors used to assign colors to image componnets.
- Note: still need to add dhh colors setup menu.

[29 December 94]
- have fg/bg/bo color for each HDD. rename some of the st.?fg colors.
- new color CC_DGREEN (dark green).
- if the waypoint pointer is off the HUD then shift it in.
- we now clear all windows when needed rather than trust the video driver
  (who does not know the backgound color) to do so.
- the 'Paused' message now uses the XOR write mode (the first time it is
  used).
- Noted: need new color mgmt menus:
	- program palette (as now).
	- assign logical colors.
	- assign HDD colors.
- add MIRROR view.
- re-arrange the LANDSCAPE view.

[28 December 94]
- replace the st.white etc. with an array st.colors[] and adjust the graphics
  logic and drivers for it.
- move e_plane from 'fly.h' to 'plane.h'. Some minor code movement to make
  a few modules plane.h clean.
- test the new system on: msdos (grfast), djgpp, unix (all 3 drivers), mswin
  (cannot run at home...).

[27 December 94]
- try to ger 386 mode to work. The problem is that the interrupts arrive
  without saving the extended registers. The solution is to protect the
  sensitive modules. I may need to simply ensure that the coms drivers
  do save extended registers.
- dynamically adjust the object refresh rate, preventing the lost/found
  cycle seen on a loaded system.
- new option 'nl' to set log flush rate. 'nl0' flushes on every log the same
  way the (removed) 'L.' option did.

[26 December 94]
- shift to G3 (386 code) on msdos/vc.
- remove palette setting from video drivers (already done in the mainline).
  also change white from '1' to '15'.
- the new colors encoding means that a new com version must be set since
  colors are exchanged in a non-portable way :-(
- add pause after 'outp()' for msdos.

[25 December 94]
- even newer memory manager, used little more space and is quicker.
- change BUFLINE to a list of shorts instead of the 3-item struct.
- add st.buf_p/ st.buf_end for speeding up the building of the display list.
- review compile options to optimize memory usage against speed ("no one will
  even need more than 640k". yeah).

[20 December 94]
- use stats.h instead of constants.
- added sys_poll() to oplane.

[19 December 94]
- applied Mike's fix for grmswin.
- noted that memory.c on msdos/vc1.5 often dies horribly is compiled with
  optimization... Also, the compile step itself dies (needs a hard reboot)
  all too often.
- new memory manager is very nice and useful for msdos. Not so much needed
  for unix.

[18 December 94]
- packet_new/_del() now uses two parameters for data/header size. Reduce
  granularity to 32. Allow zero length data/header.
- add memory garbage collection.
- add STRdup() that uses our memory mgr.
- cleanup the memory system now that all modules use it.
- add debug facilitied to memory mgr (MEM_DEBUG).

[14 December 94]
- msdos/pcudp no errors now. Also fixed common/udp.c which dropped many
  packets due to a sign extension bug.

- use KF_MENU for menu starting.
- menu.info now toggles by default.

[ 4 December 94]
- show frm/sec in termination summary.
- fix pitch.c to NOT zero-divide in get_cue()...
- accept console keys. Still cannot properly read keyboard keys (like CTRL-F1
  or such).
- add menu.options.PauseMsg to elliminate the "paused" message if you want
  clean screen captures.

[ 1 December 94]
- add Linux/svgalib driver. Now we can add this line to the table below:

	svgalib (grsvga)  67	1459
- rename keyboard_* to kbrd_* in keyboard.c to avoid conflicts with svgalib.

[27 November 94]
- some renaming in grstat.c, also make it part of the bGr family.
- add Image based X11 driver (Gri) to the Pixmap based (Grx) already
  there. It is very slow.
- added shared-memory, MUCH faster! Here are some relative times for or
  my ISA ET4000 slow card on a 486DX2/66. Time is ms/frame and each test
  was 100 seconds, in a window of 640x480.

			Time	Frames
	Gri (ShmImage)	 162	 613
	Gri (Image)	1897	  52
	Grx (PixMap)	 225	 443
	Grx (direct)	 116	 859
	msdos (grfast)	  62	1552 (expected SVGA performance?)

- for timing, count Flush as 'PageFlip'.
- move shares sources to /common

[26 November 94]
- use SetOption() for command toggling too.
- add 'command' menu.
- remove ALL video text functions (always use stroke). (all video drivers
  had functions removed!).

  'shutters=' option to video driver instead. Shutters() returns an 'int'.
- remove font files (*.fnt) from fly8.
- add 'colors' list to options menu..
- convert 'font' display to a proper list
- show version on strip.
- add *extra to all drivers.
- tested: msdos[+], unix[+], djgpp[+]
- now we call SetVisual(0) even for single buffering.
- add new options "single" and "direct" to UNIX/grx.c.

[24 November 94]
- rename 'history' to 'bhistory' etc.
- split from hud.c: bhistory.c, vv.c, waypoint.c, alarms.c

- add '_xpixels' to buffer-drawing routines.

[ 5 November 94]
- djgpp/grasm et. al.: add type BPTR for buffer pointer type, add 'b' in
  front of the function names. This way mswin/WinG can use these routines.
- remember that DJGpp fails on hud.c, so for now use
	make SHFLAGS=-O1 hud.o

[29 October 94]
- djgpp/grasm.c driver: remove usage of gr lib write mode. Split line.c
  into low.c, now line.c and ellipse.c are very device independent.

[21 October 94]

[21 April 94]
- Borland c2 works OK. bc3 still dies on comms.

[20 April 94]
- Borland c3 now works with full optimization and with asm support. It seems
  to have a bad habit of not maintaining 'ds' so the low level routines had
  to be upgraded to look after themselves. More testing needed.

[19 April 94]
- Borland c3 works fine, but had to disable all optimizations. Will give it
  a bit more time.

[30 January 94]
- oops! gear[] array was defined as [3] but prm.c was storing [5]!
- Keep track of gear up/down position.

  Now Snd and Kbd are set to valid dummy drivers when not active (same as
  Tm and Sys already do). New nokbd.c.
- Looks good, proceed with release packaging. Linux builds and runs with no
  problems. MsWindows now works too.
- rename pointer options to shorter names.

[17 January 94]

  buttons. The joystick uses 0-3 for the main ones, 4-7 for the hat and 8
  for the hat-center position. The mouse uses 0-1.
- add button release feature.

[ 8 January 94]
- define all analog functions as pointer input.

  the match is tested only for the length of the reply. Only the first match
  is selected.
- change the interface to remote.c: remove 'mode' and use special 'player'
  records to denote special destinations.

- fix 2: oplane.c, beep on target lock only for main player.


Fly8 1.00[beta] released mid May 93 but took a while to get there. I
returned home by the end of June and did some more uploading.
