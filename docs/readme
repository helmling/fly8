To install fly8, unpack the archive in a directory called fly8 (or
whatever you prefer). You should have now the main directory with a
number of sub-directories for the different platforms and a DOCS
directory.

 If you are installing on a supported platform then use that directory
and just add some extra switches to the programs when you find some
minor incompatibilities.

 If this is a new platform then create a new sub-directory and copy into
it the files from the most similar platform already supported.

 Now if you (say) are installing on a unix platform called MOON, do the
following:

1 Copy (or link) the file 'UNIX/makefile.top' to 'makefile' in the main
directory.

2 Edit 'makefile' so that these two lines now read:

SYSTEM= UNIX
SFLAGS= -D$(SYSTEM) -DMOON

 Also adjust the libs as needed (SCO needs -lsocket):

LIBS = -lm -lX11


3 'UNIX/makefile' does a 'ranlib'. If you do not use it then comment that
line.

4 do 'make' in the main directory. Then do 'make install'.

 If all went ok then you now have 'fly8'. Try it by running 'fly' in the
install directory (you should have X active or else set the DISPLAY
environment variable to an X server display).

 If you have problems, edit as needed. Try and use '#ifdef MOON'
whenever possible. If you have to change anything in the main directory
then please email me about it. Also I will be glad to hear about any new
port.

 For all bug reports, suggestions, questions etc. contact me by email.
