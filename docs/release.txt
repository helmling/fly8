This is version 1.12 of Fly8, a flight simulator which I wrote. It
can be freely distributed in the spirit of the GNU copyleft. It includes
the full sources.

It is available for FTP from

What's new in 1.12:
-------------------

WinNT, 95:
 DirectDraw support (thanks Chris!)

win3.11:
 winsock networking supported.

djgpp:
 v2 supported.
 networking supported.


The files are:
--------------

Each binary package is complete and needs no other files.

Linux
=====

The Linux version expects a joystick driver (if you want to use the joystick).
A driver is provided in the UNIX/js directory of the source release. It is
a loadable module so there is no point is releasing it in binary form.


msdos
=====

The msdos port needs at least a 386!.

It works with microsoft (qc, c7, vc1 (c8)), Borland (c2, c3, c4) and
DJgpp (v1 v2).


After unpacking the binaries the game should be playable. However, you
should review the contents of the fly.ini file and adjust it for your
environment. For example, the msdos defaults to run at 640x350 (which is
bad and slow) and you will want to switch to something like 800x600 or
1024x768 (or better if you got the memory) using the 'grfast' driver.
You may also wish to change the pointing device to joystick or mouse
(depending on what is available on your platform).

The msdos port includes a modified graphics driver which may not work on all
machines. I will try and help but, real problems can only be solved by
someone with access to your type of video system.

A new program, the 'univbe' driver has been out for a while and it provides
support for most video cards. However, it is shareware, so I cannot bundle it
with my free game. If enough people start using the univbe and will ask for
a driver that uses it then I should be able to do so.


msdos/DJgpp
===========

There are two internal graphics drivers, grdj and grasm. The first one uses
the standard graphics library that comes with DJgpp. The second is my own
asm level rewrite which is faster and supports double buffering. You need
an ET4000 card or a VESA VBE compatible driver to use grasm. Have a look at
the readme and at fly.ini.

The v2 build had it's own driver 'grvbe' which needs a VBE environment
to run in.
