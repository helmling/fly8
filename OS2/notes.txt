[ 2 Sep 96 EL]

src:
	- directory not cleaned (stuff from common not removed)
	- has a file C.CMD ?

binary:
	- should be in a subdir fly8/*.* to reduce damage from improper
	  extraction.
	* data/cpp.exe missing, but used by build. (Mike, did you
	  check that /data is proper?)
	* fly8.doc missing ('make install' should copy it). Need to fix
	  the makefile.
	- *.mac and *.log should be deleted just before packaging and
	  fly.ini set to default values.


legend:
- why do you leave me all this work?
* cannot be released in this way.
