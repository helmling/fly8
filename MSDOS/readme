UDP support was added using direct packet driver access. This now allows
msdos and unix to work together. The server must still run on the unix
side. Mswin311 now supports UDP as well and can also run the UDP server,
so you do not have to have a unix server.

For graphics you can use these modes:

1 Generic graphics. Slow but works with most cards. It uses the microsoft
  C library graphics support. It even supports Hercules if you install
  msherc.com (found in utils.zip). It does not support double buffering
  at high resolutions (640x350x16 is the higest for this). Use it if all
  else fails.

  Use 'dvgrqc Vgrqc' for the microsoft graphics. It should work on all cards.

NOTE: in the distributed binary this driver was removed in order to save
memory!

2 Lean and mean 'GrFast'. I wrote this low level driver for high performance.
  It does not support all chips and probably never will. However this is your
  best mode if it works.

  Use 'dvgrfast:* Vgr#' with '*' and '#' from the table at the end of this
  file.

3 Second best, use GrFast with VESA support. For this your card should
  support VESA page flipping. Many don't. However, there is a nice shareware
  program 'univbe' which supports many cards, give it a try.

  Use 'dvgrfast:vesa Vgrvesa1p'. For 2MB cards use '2p'. If your card does
  not support page flipping (Fly8 with double buffering gives garbage) then
  use 'grvesa1' and '2'. This will work with most VESA drivers even if
  they do not have page flipping but you will see some flicker.

4 A VESA VBE based driver 'grvesa'is not as fast as 'grfast' but is leaner
  since it has NO native support for any chip. In the future I will remove
  all native chip support and trust the VBE BIOS to be there.

5 The version built with bcc has a BGI based driver, 'grbgi' but it was
  found to be slow and limited so I do not recommend it.
  If I see enough need for it then I will put some effort into upgrading it.

NOTE: in the distributed binary this driver was removed in order to save
memory!

  You will probably put the 'dvgr# Vgr*" options in your fly.ini so that you
will not need to repeat it for each run.

  A description of the *.vmd file structure is given in the doco. The
important item is the video mode which is the first option after the mode
name (e.g. 0x13 for 320x200x256 mode). GrFast supports only the 256 color
modes (called PL8 in whatvga.lst). GrQc supports all modes.

  To create the missing gr#.vmd files consult the attached whatvga.lst
file. It comes from the vgadoc3.zip file which is available on common
archive sites and included with the msdos binaries.

  The whatvga.exe program can detect the type of graphics chip in your
machine. It is from the vgadoc3.zip package, the whatvga.doc file describes
what it does.


  The above files are packages inside whatvga.zip.

  Test against your card. Be carefull not to blow your screen (all too
easy to do with older ones). Please email me any working *.vmd files for
inclusion in later releases.

  You can name the modes file whatever you want (with the extension .vmd)
but you cannot change the 'dvgrfast:*' chip name, you must quote one of
the names from the next list.
