v1
==

This port was brought up to date with version 1.12. I had problems with
'make' running out of memory, so I used NDmake. However, with the
standard make, if you get errors like 'not enough memory to run GO32'
then do the make by hand, For example, a batch file like the following
can be executed from the main directory.

To build, do:

Set your djgpp compiler properly.

	cd fly8
	djgpp\config v1

And edit the top Makefile for the correct directories.

	cd djgpp
	make aobjs >>..\errs
	cd ..

	cd shapes
	make all >>..\errs
	cd ..

	cd parms
	make all >>..\errs
	cd ..

	make all install >>errs


There are a few video drivers:

GrDJ: uses the standard DJgpp graphics library and will work if the
library works for you.

GrAsm: Handles the video directly. It has native support for ET4000
based cards and generic support for VESA/VBE compliant cards. If you do
not have a VESA driver for your card then get 'univbe' off the net and
it will probably work for you.

GrVBE: Uses VBE 2.0 to access the video memory. Can only be used with
banked frame buffer modes (not with linear memory). When possible, use
it since it will work with all VBE enabled cards.

GrAsm (and GrVBE) are much faster than GrDJ and should be used whenever
possible.

As of this version communication if fully supported, over packet driver,
either using the raw pc<->pc 'pkt' or the UDP based 'pcudp' drivers.


v2
==

To build, do:

Set your djgpp compiler properly.

	cd fly8
	djgpp\config v2

And edit the top Makefile for the correct directories, then:

	redir -oe make all install >errs


You can use only two graphics drivers, GrAsm and GrVBE. GrAsm can only
be used with a linear video memory mode.
